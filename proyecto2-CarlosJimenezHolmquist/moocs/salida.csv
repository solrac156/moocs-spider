Incredibly valuable course. Probability is a foundational topic that needs to be thoroughly internalized for follow-on work in the sciences - these instructors are quite literally among the best in the world and have absolutely achieved this in an online setting. Well-paced  challenging and incredibly rewarding. Thank you MIT and thank you professors Tsitsiklis  Jaillet and Bertsekas!,10,Completed,h c,2 years  3 months ago
Truly excellent in every dimension. Beautiful constructed lectures  fantastic TAs  challenging and rewarding problem sets  fantastic material.   Challenging to keep up with the workload but well worthwhile.   Best MOOC I've taken by a good margin.,10,Completed,Hal Ashburner,3 months ago
This is an introductory course on probability theory  but  it's very hard (after all  it's from MIT). The materials  which have covered all the related topics on probability  are organized quite well and illustrated in a gradual and clear way. A lot of difficult exercises are required  but they are very useful to help students understand the concepts and master the calculation ways. The whole course lasts for 16 weeks (oh my god!)  but when I insist on to the end  I have learnt so much and feel so satisfied. Thank you  Prof. John Tsitsiklis and the course staff!,10,Completed,Jiting Tian,5 months ago
Amazing course  a must do for all those aspiring to be machine learning engineers. The presentation is very clear and concise  and presented in an intuitive way.,10,Taking Now,Divya K,8 months  1 week ago
It's really nerdy.  It's profoundly math-y.  It's quite challenging  often mind-bendingly so.  And it is  without a doubt  the best-taught  most comprehensive probability course out there or even imaginable.  Over 16 fast-paced weeks  this course covers every major topic in probability and zips through statistics for good measure.  The syllabus includes combinatorics  conditional probability and Bayes' Rule  random variables of many types  expectation and variance  covariance and correlation  error and estimation  the law of large numbers and the Central Limit Theorem  Poisson and Bernoulli processes  and Markov chains.  There are weekly problem sets  two midterm-like exams and a final  and graded in-lecture exercises.  Expect to spend 10 to 15 hours a week on the course.  The lectures are given primarily by Prof. Tsitsiklis  but for each unit there is also an ESSENTIAL sequence of (ungraded) solved problems taught by a team of extremely talented TAs.  These and the in-lecture exercises  which count for a small fraction of the grade  really provide the intellectual framework for the problem sets and exams.  Don't skip them  and even if you got an answer right  read the provided solutions!  The rigorous  often abstract thought processes needed to succeed with the material are not natural -- you really have to train your mind to work in new ways  and the exercises and solved problems show the way.  The staff is enthusiastic and responsive  while some MOOCs enter a kind of zombie mode after the first couple of sessions  this one retains the energy of a brand-new offering.    If I have one modest complaint about the course  it's the relentlessly theoretical perspective.  To me  probability problems take on life when they're about batting averages  the spread of disease  and stochastic phenomena in nature.  In this course  most of the problems involve cards  coins  and characters named Alice and Bill.  You may be charmed by esoteric distinctions between numbers and random variables  but i could have used a little more Moneyball.  This  however  is a minor quibble.  The material is foundational and supremely valuable across innumerable scientific and technical disciplines.  Make the necessary time and devote the required effort  and the rewards will more than compensate.,10,Completed,Steven Frank,8 months  2 weeks ago
"An excellent cource in probability theory!  It is pretty challenging  especially in the middle  but  as it's said  ""no pain - no gain"" :) I used to spend 20+ hours per week during some weeks.  This course gives one a solid understanding of probability theory fundamentals. Highly recommended for everyone except those who do already have a solid background in probability theory (the course will seem too basic) and those who just want to get some intuition about probability without going into details (the course will seem too hard).",10,Completed,Mikhail Surovikov,8 months  2 weeks ago
In order to get the most out of this course in my opinion you need to be prepared to commit a substantial amount of time  perhaps more than the advertised amount  particularly if you have no prior knowledge of the subject matter. However  if you do spend this time  you will find the lecturers are top notch (as well as the TAs). The structure of the course attempts to mirror the on-campus version of lectures  recitations  homework and exams to immerse you thoroughly and all-in-all  provides a excellent introduction.,10,Completed,mark m0001,8 months  2 weeks ago
"Pros :   Course Content :  Simply one word - Excellent !! Provided that you are determined to put extra effort ! This is not an easy (""cake walk"") kind of MOOC like others. At the end of this course you will take away a lot ! You will feel that you have a good knowledge of the subject !  And I can not stop my self from saying --   I love you Prof. John Tsitsiklis and I love you  MIT !  Instructor:  I have no words to describe how good is a teaching style of Prof. John Tsitsiklis - he is just amazing. More importantly  he doesn't *assume* that the audiance knows the concept.  He explains each and everything in great detail so at the end of the course you will feel  that you have gained a lot from this course !  lots of quizes  problems for solid conceptual clarity !  Provider : I really like the ambiance and structure the way edX has organized the course material. I have taken courses from Coursera  Udacity etc. But I love edX the most.. Well researched way of organizing the course material.  Cons:  I think MIT should add may be 20-25% extra time for completing assignments. I am a working professional and took up the course with ""Verified Certificate""  although I am highly motivated to get the certificate  but at the end of Chap. 7 I lost the track. All assinment submissions were on Thursday in my timezone (India) and I am ususally very busy from Mon-Fri. So I could not complete the assignments - Not because I could not solve the problems  but because the deadline was during weekdays - so I couldn't even look at the problems !! I think MIT must keep the deadline only on weekends or Monday for all timezones  even if it means giving extra time and extra problems to solve. This is the only flaw I found in this course.  Although I have lost the chance of earning the certificate I am determined to look at all the problems and solve them and complete the course. Hopefully it will greatly enhance my understanding of Probability theory.  --  Thank you edX  MIT and Prof. Tsitsiklis for a great work !",10,Taking Now,Onkar Mahajan,9 months ago
"Simply outstanding. This topic can be a bit boring and dry to study from a book but the professor and excellent TAs do a fantastic job in running this finely crafted and refined course like clockwork. I will be forever indebted to the MITx team and the professor in particular for providing such an outstanding learning experience.    The course is a pretty big time commitment and runs for a lot longer than the typical ""dumbed down"" online courses and I am really grateful for it.",10,Taking Now,Student,9 months  4 weeks ago

Terrific course. This course was much more informative and useful than any of the statistics coursework I took as a graduate student in the natural sciences at Michigan State University. The teaching was also at a much higher caliber.,10,Completed,Rohan M,1 year ago
This is by far the best probability & statistics course available--online or in the classroom. I took a related course from another university and was lost and confused until I found this course. I have also viewed several related MOOCs from other providers  and they are nowhere near as effective and informative as this one. Thank you to the professors  teaching assistants  and MIT for making this invaluable resource available to the world! Please consider offering this as a self-paced course to earn a certificate.,10,Taking Now,M W,1 year  4 months ago
The material was presented intuitively  the lessons were accessible  the exercises helped cement understanding  and overall the class was great. John Tsitsiklis and his team make the intuition stick.

Well... why is there just 5 stars to rate this course? I could easily give twice than that! In fact  this is the best MOOC on probability and definitely one of the best MOOCs I've ever taken on edX or elsewhere. It is well-structured  well-paced and  which is of prime importance  perfectly taught by Prof. Tsitsiklis. Thorough explanations of the major topics are enriched by examples and supplemental videos delivered by students (not sure they are indeed students  but very smart guys anyway :). The objectives and outcomes of every course unit are clearly defined and precisely pursued in lectures. Oh  I can add more and more to that  but you've already got my point. What’s left to say is to express my deepest gratitude to Prof.  Tsitsiklis and his team for their amazing job! I have to admit  however  that I went through an archived version of this course in a rush to help me basically speed up with yet another MOOC  but I felt its depth and efforts invested by the Professor... I wish I would have time to take an active version of MITx:6.041x under 'normal conditions' to appreciate it to the full!,10,Taking Now,student,1 year  4 months ago
This is a top-notch challenging course. Everything is perfect from lectures to the design of problem sets exams and the engaging of the staff in the discussion board.

Excellent course! Be prepared for a long haul - 10 units @ min 5h per unit. Very heavy on notation & math expression and may be difficult to do for long stretches. But if you persist  you will be rewarded with a very good understanding of the topic. The problems are very well set - infact they are beautiful!!,10,Taking Now,V R,1 year  11 months ago
This is the best course I've taken on edx. It was hard to do everything while working fulltime  but it was worth it because I learned so much afterwards and I'm applying it right now in machine learning. I liked that it was hard and they didn't water it down just because it's a MOOC. I liked that it was rather challenging and the homework wasn't trivial  I often don't have time to complete everything before the due date  but the grade doesn't matter to me  so I still think about the problems and work them out even after the deadline. I liked how much material there was -- you had the lectures and also tutorial sessions where they go over example problems  all of which were very useful. Overall  this course took a lot of effort  like most of my weekends and weeknights  and I gained a lot from it. I am grateful that the instructors took the time to make the materials and put the course online.,10,Completed,student,2 years  3 months ago
"No neurology background is required: the basics of not only the theory of neural systems but the practice of laboratory work in the field is presented clearly and engagingly by the lecturers  which was perfect for me as a newcomer to the subject.  However  this is primarily a data analysis course  so if you're after depth in neural science  you might look elsewhere.  I have a strong background in computer science  so it is difficult for me to gauge this  but I suspect that  despite the whirlwind tour of python in the first week  some familiarity with basic programming control structures would make the course more enjoyable  even if it was only at the level of say Code Academy. I enjoyed the material on python libraries numpy  matplotlib and pandas.  The assessed work includes four auto-graded programming assignments and associated multi-choice quizzes  and a final project. Each assignment focuses on specific analyses of specific data sets. The data sets are interesting  but there's no cohesive overview of common approaches and the areas they're best applied to.  This would be a four star review if not for the autograder. On a couple of assignments  my code worked flawlessly (and without overfitting) on all the practice datasets  but a couple of the grader tests failed without any response beyond ""fail"". With no further information to be wrung out of the system  and not willing to waste time with endless rounds of outguess-the- grader  for the first time in my MOOC career I had to just write a few marks off.  (By way of comparison  I'm simultaneously taking Pavel Pevzner's brilliant Bioinformatics Algorithms I . It too gives a binary success/fail response on ""code challenge"" submissions  but in this case it is always very clear what is being tested  and there's never yet been a time where my code produced the correct output on the practice data sets but failed to on the test one. I'm running at full marks.)  Each assignment also has a peer assessed portion  but these simply check that data plots match a detailed rubric  and there's a minimum of subjectivity involved. Only the other hand  the project is worth 40% of the final grade  is largely self-directed  and entirely peer assessed. If this is not your cup of tea or you don't feel taking your chances with which peer your work is assigned to  this may not be the best course for you.",6,Taking Now,Henrietta Livingstone,3 years  2 months ago
Might possibly be worth doing in another presentation  if they fixed the problems  but the first was disappointing. It was marred by very poor organisation and attention to detail. For example: in several different pieces of work  the automatic grading system marked correct answers wrong. In one case this was eventually corrected but the correction introduced a new error! The course team did not make effective use of the Announcements page or the official course forums so students were left in the dark about what was going on. I gave up doing the assignments. The lectures were OK  but not great  in my opinion. Overall problem seemed to be confusion about who the course is for. It's advertised as being for complete beginners  and the lectures do start very slow (but never actually explain what kurtosis is...)  but at the end the pace is hugely faster and material is included that seems too advanced for a short intro stats course and wasn't really grounded properly. In practice  a high proportion of students on the course (who were still there a few weeks in) seemed to have taken stats courses before  or even taught them.,4,Completed,Perdita Stevens,5 years  3 months ago
I needed to learn basic stats  and R. I love how this course is just that. I went away from this course being able to process the results of my study in R. I really liked the video tutorials because Conway went through the output and explained each step. This gave me intuition to be able to understand the output when I ran my stats. I wish there were more stats courses offered by this university and teacher.,10,Completed,Student,3 years ago
I really enjoyed this class. I think the professor does a great job of presenting the material. I took this class in its first iteration and the only negative thing I have to say is about the student community. At that time  the forums were overshadowed by people who seemed to have some kind of personal vendetta against professor Conway. It was really sad to see. There is a programming tool called 'R' that you will need to learn. It is very easy to learn. It is used by statisticians all over the world. I think too many people didn't have an understanding of the mathematics and other skills needed for a statistics class. (even an introductory one) Having said that  I think this was a great introduction to statistics. I like the real world examples he used. I would recommend this to everyone.,10,Completed,Robert Davis,3 years  8 months ago
"Overall I thought it was very good. I took statistics many years ago so this was a good way to refresh my knowledge on the subject. My only ""complaint"" is that some of the lab exercises felt a little disconnected from the lectures  where we had to take extra steps that were not mentioned in the videos in order to solve the problems. Anyway  I really did like it and would take further courses on the subject if they were offered by Prof. Conway.",8,Completed,Carolina Sh.,3 years  10 months ago
"This is my 10th or so course and my 4th statistics course on Coursera after ""Computing for Data Analysis""  ""Data Analysis""  ""Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1"" I got the maximum score for all assignments and 24 out of 25 at the midterm. However this is the worst class I took on Coursera and here's why: The material is dense but fails to properly cover the basics and merely glancing through them. The homeworks are very easy and don't require a proper understanding of the material. Out of 10 questions sometimes you can do them all mechanically without having to understand much. Also it's not uncommon to have 3 different  yet semantically identical questions such as 1\. what is the covariance between x and y 2\. what is the covariance between x and z 3\. what is the covariance between y and z However even though the homework takes about 10-30 minutes to complete (sometimes less than 10). It may take another 30 minutes to figure out what the format is for some of the answers. It can be so frustrating it feels like a bad joke. Sometimes you have to write integer values  sometimes 2 decimals rounded values  but it won't accept them unless you type them in a particular format (which is not explained). For example in the same assignment an answer needs to be formatted as ""0.19"" and anther answer needs to be "".19""  just because. Also these rules seem to be changing between assignments. The forums have more questions/comments about answer format than for the actual assignment. Here's an example ""I feel like every time there was a confidence interval question  there was a different format. I got 8 points from 2 attempts and then lost another 5 trying to guess the format until I came here. Was it so difficult to let us use any format we want and then check that our result is within a certain error range? Coursera does stuff much more complex than this at other courses. I am disappointed."" ""Quiz 7 Q4 & 5  Q6 & Q7 format"" had 68 questions/comments when I wrote this (https://class.coursera.org/stats1-002/forum/thread?thread_id=2180) and there were other parallel threads.",4,Taking Now,Cosmin Lehene,4 years  3 months ago
"I was very excited about the course when I first saw the syllabus. The reason was the coverage of the topics. It starts from very basics and attempts to teach advanced topics through the course. However  as the course proceeds  I realized that the attempt of covering large number of topics is actually a bad idea. Since the course attempts to cover too many topics in 3 months  the lectures were not in depth at all. It is a statistics course  with just a few slides with formulas. Some people may think that it is something good  but I think otherwise. Dr. Conway tries to explain ideas too ""intuitively"". The statistical methods were not explained in depth at all. The slides are not useful  especially for self-study. Unfortunately  the labs was not good either. I see the difficulty of teaching statistics and programming language for practice at the same time. Since the concepts were not covered enough in the lectures  most weeks  using R to practice concepts discussed in the lecture was like black magic. Just call the function that is asked  find the number in the output and that's it. Towards the end of the course  it became obvious to me. Finally  I realized that I don't learn anything anymore and decided to drop the course.",4,Dropped,Sefa Kilic,4 years  2 months ago
"Since i do have some familiarity with Statistics  the syllabus looked good. But the student has to learn the ""R"" programming system at the same time as he/she is absorbing the concepts and doing the calculations. Course would be better if a week or two were devoted to learning the R programming system  but the course is already rather lengthy as it is. Definitely NOT ""friendly"".",2,Dropped,Winthrop Yu,4 years  3 months ago
"I am really enjoying this class  and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn statistics. I am concurrently enrolled in Calculus  and I find comparisons of these two classes interesting. I find the professor very engaged and working very hard to provide excellent teaching. The material is well thought out and clearly presented. It looks to me like there are challenges for a statistics teacher that are different from those faced by a calculus teacher. The repetition of calculating calculus problems provides a sense of ""learning the material"" for me that I don't feel as strongly in this course. The weekly labs in R are great  I just think it is harder to master the material when you are ""evaluating output."" There are two minor issues I have with the class  and they are really just personal preference. First  the professor stays away from greek symbols opting instead for abbreviations such as SD for standard deviation. The second issue is that all of the data appears to be made up. With all the open data  it would be more engaging for me to work with real datasets. I love the class tho and recommend it highly - particularly for someone looking for a review of statistics or a second look at the material with an R perspective.",8,Taking Now,Jamie Lytle,4 years  2 months ago
Presentation and organization of the lectures was fine. Sometimes it lacked some precise definitions  but the key topics were well explained. Working in R was almost not explained at all  only examples of how to solve some very specific tasks. Anything else was left to the student to find out. That's OK for me as a programmer  it's what I do every day  but for other people it may be more annoying. What was really disappointing was the interactive parts of the course. Quizzes where you wouldn't see if you answered correctly or what was wrong with your answer. Sometimes even the marking was plain wrong. How does that help learning? (I believe that should be the main benefit of quizzes  not the grades) None of the staff were active in the discussion forum  only later I found that there was some facebook group (created by students) where staff replied from time to time. What's the point of having a discussion forum  then? In the end  I've dropped the course after some six weeks because I simply had better things to do.,4,Completed,Michal,5 years  1 month ago
Great course! Although it may not be actually for someone without any background in statistics or programming  it was very enjoyable for me with a very basic background in statistics (i had taken a couple of courses in my BS) and some programming during highschool using visual basic and delphi  neither of them are like R o Pyhton but taught me the rigorousness of syntax and semantics in programming. Strictly talking from the course at the end it was too much info but still was manageable. Maybe it was a bit tedious to know all the background from the examples used for statistical analysis (like the history of a basketball player or salaries in certain departments of the university) but in the end of the analysis that background made more clear and important the numbers that such analysis gave pointing out to much real conclusions and making better examples. In my belief the course would be better if it had more time (either from the course as from the students) to explain the topics with more fundamental principles and more examples (being this the reason why I don't rate it with 5 stars). Finally I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn statistics and has at least barely knowledge of the theme and patience to learn R.,9,Completed,Carlos Flores,5 years ago
I had to drop out  partly because I joined the course in the middle and already missed deadline. I was also taking 3 other courses  so had to drop this one out.

"I actually don't agree that this class was ""designed to be a friendly introduction to fundamental concepts in statistics"". The lecture on descriptive statistics even states that it should be review. That doesn't mean it was a bad course.

Excellent content and outstanding teacher.

"This course is a solid complement to MIT's edx series ""Introduction to Probability"". The course is much shorter and easier than the MIT series  and more practically oriented since it includes programming assignments. It's also easier than coursera's Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camps. Sadly  there are no advanced statistics online courses available yet (neither MIT nor coursera are advanced).   The course includes a decent quality jupyter notebooks that allow students to interactively play with the concepts presented in the lectures  but the Python programming assignments and quizzes are trivial. For example the Week 6 programming assignments consists of just a single line computing the Bayes rule.  The main problem of this course is the complete lack of @staff interaction on the forums. There are no @staff reactions to the mistakes found in the course materials. Moreover the materials are released with delays. A minor problem is in some videos being unedited and containing repeated sequences. Another minor problem is in the programming assignments in Python 2 instead of Python 3  entirely due to the obsolete usage of the print statement instead of the print function  the latter introduced in Python 2.6 in 2008.   Some students report the course being difficult. It may be difficult for someone coming from low profile high school  but the course is trivial for any natural science college sophomore. The passing grade is set to 50% which allows one to obtain a passing grade after about 2/3 of the course and even without attempting the final exam.  Other complaints are that the course does not prepare for the data science subject since it focuses on probability and statistics. Such complaints are made by drop out students who do not understand the data science field. The probability/statistics material presented in this course won't suffice for any serious data science work.",6,Completed,N A,3 weeks  5 days ago
Could you please take a look at this course and please consider letting us take it again? This time we will have some notice and idea of how to prepare for this unusually difficult course and I will free up my schedule for ten weeks so I can dedicate extra time for this one course. I had no problem in the first course at all and it took 6-8 hours a week. This course was taking 3 hours a day and sometimes even longer. I am good at python and had no problem using statists in python for machine learning  this course was a show stopper for me and I dropped the course because I had no idea it would be this dense and there was no way I could finish by the deadline. I am having no problem in Udacity's statistics courses for reference. I also had no problem with Docker or the first part of the course with the coin examples  that's fine. After that it gets super dense  just way too much crammed in each week. This could easily be two courses. Could you please reply so I know if I should wait to re-attempt the MicroMaster program.

I agree with the other two reviews of this course is a complete waste of money if your looking to learn data science and python.  I feel this course in the content given so far is not a data science course at all but a math course and nothing else.  If this course was part of some math certificate as a person with a math degree I would have given a 5.  Like the other students I agree this course is very hard and time consuming but would be fine if it said it was a match course.  As say its part of a data science course yet we have never used a data set or learned any of the data science tools and libraries that python has do do this type of analysis you learn nothing that can be used in the real world at this this point.  Plus as be mention the staff never responds to students issues plus for some reason every week they have technically difficulty in uploading the material so a student can never plain ahead on how to study this material as we never know when we will get the videos plus it for some reason takes them another week to two to post the slides for these videos.  Not all people can learn by watching videos we also need the written notes as some people learn better by reading the material.  I also have no idea what the first course got us to install anaconda and use python 3 then this course the second makes us download and use python 2 how about build on what the first course did and don't make students download something else.  As been mention this course is waste of money but fine to audit and re learn math if your interested in just learning math. The biggest reason not to pay for this is the complete lack of support by the staff and there inability of fix there own technical issues in a timely manner or attempt to fix the issues that students have brought up because I've contacted edx many times about this course and they have let me know many students have voices issues about this course and not once has this been really addressed.,1,Taking Now,Student 1,1 month  1 week ago
To be honest  I think professor Alon Orlitsky one of the best professors in statistics field and he is very clear so he deserves 5 stars and this is my opinion. But the content of this course not related to Data Science until now (week 7) and the content of this course very heavy  I can't watch box office movies which have more than 2 hours so how I can watch approximately 4 hours of math videos every week with many quizzes  problems sets and programming assignments. The professor know there are many students in this course have math allergic and they are here just to learn statistics beyond machine learning and very important statistics tools in Data Science like Numpy  Scipy  Itertools  Pandas  Sklearn and very important algorithms like Naive Bayes  Regression  Classification  Clustering  Support Vector Machines  Decision Trees  Ensemble Learning and Random Forests and how to build all these using math and using only Numpy. I don't know why the professor Alon Orlitsky doesn't focus on very important topics in statistics for Data Science and I don't know why he just focuses on math equations which are not related or not important in Data Science or not used in real-world. And I don't know why the course staff makes the problem sets and programming assignments very long and very difficult. I write this review because I and many students wrote many compliments on the discussion forums but nothing changes so far.,1,Taking Now,Student MM-DS,1 month  4 weeks ago
I'm sorry to say that  This course is quite unlike the previous one (Python for Data Science). It is very difficult and not useful because of nothing here about data science or machine learning. Everything here about coin  dice and card game it is like K12 math but harder. I expected I will learn the mathematical foundations for machine learning and I will learn statistical tools in python and I will learn to visualize data but the problem no data in this course no datasets just a lot of math equations. Also  the notebooks are terrible and very old (python 2) and not related to the course it is about difficult programming assignments without anything useful just solve this problem about dice and solve this problem about coins or card game and nothing real or related to real world. Also  there are 10 problem sets every week and every problem have 4 questions and all questions fill in the blank. Also  there are 10 questions in Comprehension Quiz every week. Also  there are more than 10 very long videos every video between (20 - 40 min). Also  the course staff don't answer most questions for students but sometimes answer a few questions after many weeks. At the end  this course requires between (25 - 40 hours) per week and you will get a very bad grade. It is a complete waste of time and money. So if you have more than 300 hours to learn the math behind coin  dice  balls and card game this course will be very good for you. But if you want to learn Statistics and Probability in Data Science using Python just stay away.,1,Taking Now,Rhitik Bhatt,1 month  4 weeks ago
If you're new to the subject of astronomy  this MOOC could be a good place to start. You just have 5 videos per week  each ranging from 5-15 minutes (except for the first week  you have 4) and a weekly quiz. Get 65% of the points and you'll earn an SoA. Andy and Catherine are two great instructors- they make everything look so simple (although  astronomy is not at all easy to grasp in my view).

The course was a great introduction to the technical side of Astronomy and Astrophysics  offering some  insight into those physical objects used to gather data on far-away objects. It discusses some of the history of lens and camera technology  some important equations and terminology used in the field. The course follows a logical format  laying the foundation of tools in order to discuss the science behind the use of those tools. The forums were rather active  with the two lecturers and their teaching staff being involved in many of the discussions.

I thought they would show all the different kinds of telescopes for example. What I see is quite a confusing mix of bits and pieces of certain aspects that kind of seem to be picked randomly.

"I'm dropping this course after 5 weeks. There are good bits about this course  but you can probably read about those in other reviews. I'll focus on the bad bits. First of all  it does not make sense to follow this kind of quality course after the high quality courses ""Data Analysis and Statistical Inference"" on coursera and MIT's ""Introduction to Probability"" on Edx which cover similar topics  but in much greater depth and with much more rigour. I'm sure Boris Mirkin is very knowledgeable  but i.m.h.o. he lacks the educational skills. Sometimes the language he uses gets in the way. At other times he explains bits left and right without a clear route of understanding things with increasing complexity. There are times he does not explain why certain concepts exist or how they are used. The slides often contain too much text  numbers and formula's to be clear and informative. I found I had a better understanding when I skipped his lectures and went straight to wikipedia or some other resource. Because of that  it irritated me that he used terms and definitions in a unique ways  so that I couldn't use wikipedia or online searches to study. If I look up Quetelet Index  all I get are references to BMI (Body Mass Index)  but Boris uses that term for a general statistic. Another example is the use of ""odds-ratio"" that differs from its official definition. The programming assignments are quite easy. You can use any language or tool you like. You download a dataset and upload the answer within 5 minutes. When the answer is incorrect  you can download a new dataset and repeat until correct. The environment works. It's a bit specific about white space and punctuation. I do like the idea  but I would prefer to download from within the program using some API as some other programming courses offer. The quizzes are so so. You are asked to show you've understood the definitions and to calculate certain statistics. When doing the peer assessments  make sure to read the grading criteria  because the question does not always comply with them. I did the first run so there is room for improvement. Still I believe there are better ways to learn about the topics that are covered by this course.",6,Completed,Bart olomeus,3 years  9 months ago

This first mini-course in the [Databases series](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) from Stanford Online  focuses on introducing the concept of a Database Management System (DBMS) and the why a DBMS makes using a database easier. It then moves on to provide an overview of the relational data model and querying as used in Relational Database Managment Systems (RDBMS).  While mentions of alternative data models and DBMS (e.g. XML  Hadoop  graph data) are made  this mini-course does not provide a overview of the alternatives to RDBMS.

Just for a simple exposure for what this topic may regard to  the mini course is a nice start and also provided some basic examples to show how data can be accessed in a relational database but for someone who is more serious about the topic  please take a look at the full version course.  The full course was not in a hurry to bring up the SQL syntax but slowly build on how data can be presented in different format and some theory of relation algebra is also presented.

Managing Big Data with MySQL is the fourth and final course in Duke University's Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business specialization offered through Coursera. The 5-week course focuses on teaching students how to make relational database queries. Unlike some database courses that delve into details concerning database construction and theory  this course is all about the practical use of databases from the perspective of a business analyst. The first week introduces the concept of relational databases  entity relationship diagrams and schema  while the remainder of the course covers querying from simple select statements to summary functions  grouping  joins and subqueries. You don't need any particular background to take this course and it could be taken in isolation from the rest of the specialization. Grading is based on 4 week-end multiple-choice quizzes.    Weekly course content is divided into several lessons that typically involve watching a short video segment and then working through an exercise set in MySQL or Teradata  two relational databases used in the course. The lecture content is high quality but after the first week  you'll be spending most of your time working on exercises rather than watching videos. In fact  some lessons don't have video lectures at all: the written exercises are really the core of the course. The MySQL exercises are contained in Jupiter notebooks--interactive text and code documents--that let you read instructions and play around with code in the same place. The exercises provide plenty of opportunity to drill SQL queries and build SQL vocabulary. The answers to exercise questions are provided in PDFs (they are ungraded)  which means you can skip ahead if you don't need more practice. Considering each week after the first has at least 3 exercises sets plus a quiz  each of which could take a few hours to complete in their entirety  consulting the answer keys frequently is recommended to keep things moving along at a reasonable pace.    At the end of each week after the first you'll do a final exercise set using Teradata and answer multiple choice quiz questions based on your results. You use the same real-world data set for each quiz--product information from Dillard's department stores—helping you build some familiarity with the data by the end of the course. The final week of the course doesn't cover any new material: it just contains the final quiz.    Managing Big Data with MySQL is a great course for learning practical relational database querying skills with plenty of exercises that let you interact with real-life data sets. The focus on drilling ungraded exercises combined with sparing use of lectures after the first week does  however  make the course feel impersonal. It plays out more like a collection of training materials than the sort of university-style course you may expect from Coursera.      I give Managing Big Data with MySQL 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great.,8,Completed,Greg Hamel,1 year  11 months ago
I'm surprised that given SQL is in such high demand there are so few courses on Coursera that even touch on this topic. But that said  this is the only SQL class you need to take for becoming quite comfortable with the language. The lectures are clear and helpful. The interface is excellent. And the exercises and quizzes really help you master the materials. This is a time-consuming class  but you learn stuff that you can apply directly to your work. I've taken data science classes on Coursera from JHU and they pale in comparison to this one in terms of the depth of the materials and practicality. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn SQL.,10,Taking Now,Student,1 year  3 months ago
I like the overall course content but I think the step is too high from the first part of the course (lexical analysis  parsing) to the second part (writing assembly code from parse tree).

Apart from this  the course content is great!,6,Taking Now,Student,3 years  2 months ago
"Stanford's ""CS1 Compilers"" is less a course than a way of life -- thank goodness it's self-paced!  The experience is like being asked to translate a novel into a sequence of foreign languages you're learning for the first time.  The amount of work is prodigious  and I haven't even started the programming assignments yet.  But this course deserves its reputation as the best there is on the subject.  The instructor  Alex Aiken  is fantastic.  His articulate  conversational style is easy to follow and he assumes a minimal CS background  just C and exposure to assembly language.  The course material is broadly organized around four key components of compiler design:  syntax  parsing  semantics and type checking  and code generation.      So let's talk about the languages you'll learn.  The language for which you'll be writing a compiler is COOL  the Classroom Object-Oriented Language written by Prof. Aiken.  There's a tutorial  a reference manual  and some example programs  but ultimately this is a new C++/Java-like object-oriented programming language you'll have to learn.  Then we're on to the computer science.  Lexical analysis partitions a high-level program into its basic lexical components (keywords  numbers  etc.) using the languages of regular expressions and formal grammars.  Regular expressions  in turn  are implemented computationally by finite automata  which have their own peculiar language.  The first programming assignment  which has you writing a lexical analyzer  uses a framework called Flex or Jlex  depending on whether you're coding the assignments in C++ or Java (the only allowed choices) -- so that's another language.  The next step  parsing  uses the language of context-free grammars  and here's where things get pretty theoretical -- think parse trees and Noam Chomsky.  After you master the languages of top-down and bottom-up parsing  you can put them to work using a tool called bison (for C++) or CUP (for Java) -- so that's yet another language.  Now we're into semantic analysis and type checking  which use the rigorous language of formal logic (think mathematical proofs) and abstract syntax trees.  For the programming assignment  you'll write a semantic analyzer involving 1500-3000 lines of code.  Code generation  the final stage of the compiler you'll write  requires a fairly deep dive into assembly language (the MIPS language  in particular)  and the lectures lead you through the complexities of register and stack management.  In the programming assignment  you write a code generator (another 1500-3000 lines of C++ or Java) that creates MIPS assembly code for the abstract syntax tree generated by your semantic analyzer.      Now  all of these programming assignments are actually optional.  The mandatory assignments are six quizzes  which are difficult but allow unlimited attempts  and a midterm and final  which are killers and allow only one attempt at each question with no partial credit.  But you'd be crazy not to at least attempt the programming assignments if you want to learn about compilers.  This course is supremely well-taught and well-organized  and -- again -- mercifully self-paced.  Just know what you're getting into and buckle up.",10,Taking Now,Steven Frank,1 week  6 days ago

The main issues of this course its fast pace. Prof. Caffo tone of speech and style of lecture delivery is kind of fast and stuffed with information thus you need to stop several times more than you do in other courses for this specialization [ i.e. comparing with Dr. Peng]. Although I have taken statistical analysis in my post. grad I needed to go back and review several topics. The course companion book provided was not the best option for me [I had to refer to some Youtube videos and used the book of Introduction to Statistics and Probability by Mendhell]. I would say that swirl were a good helper after I finished the lectures. The Course project level was not on the same level with the given material to some extent although I managed to solve all the requirements. One good take of this course is I have done good amount of ggplot plots and started to understand how this great package works.

I have a mixed feelings about this course. From one side  instructors have taken an attempt to give a nice view of analytics approach to Human Resources. From the other - it's pretty obvious  that none of instructors ever worked in HR area  thus  most of the material they delivered was either pretty obvious  or completely useless in the practical perspective. If you take a course in such a narrow professional sphere  you expect to have at least a couple of real-life tools to use  when you finish the course. But unfortunately  this course is too narrow  with too shallow material  and too obvious conclusions  which instructors tried to sell to student  as a practical tool.    Also  the delivery of the materials was questionable. One of the instructors (Ilya Breiman) was not bad  but the other (Alexey Dolinskiy) was talking too fast with a nasal voice  as if he's constantly in a hurry  and a lot of things was simply hard to understand from the first time listening.

This course is not suitable for somebody without programming training even though the specialisation overview says otherwise.  The course only scratches the surface of the technologies so as at best a high level overview on the tech side.

This is quite a curious case of online course. It's totally unconventional  it's one of the worst and also one of the best. But after all it's definitely worth taking  provided it's offered again. Let me explain why  starting from cons: Cons: The course isn't really well organized. Lecture videos always arrive after their promised release time. What's more unbelievable is the other promised lecturer didn't show up at all. In the end the amount of people who did the final project(which doesn't affect the completion of the course) was shoddy. Pros: Regardless of the video lecture quality  all the resources provided by the lecturer as a seasoned Silicon Valley insider is top-notch. After going through all the readings + course notes you'll have a much much better and more systematic idea of what a startup is about  and  without exaggeration  much deeper insight on the whole world. To gain invaluable insight  experience and information in an organized form from a seasoned and quite successful startup guy is wonderful and will help you form correct notions about many things in the beginning  helping you save unnecessary wasted time. Also the skills he taught are quite useful as well. The cons are probably because the lecturer was just too busy. After all he is not a pure professor  but also the boss of a startup company. So I actually doubt whether this course will get offered again. But for all the resources it's definitely worthy to do.,9,Completed,Xiang Ji,4 years  2 months ago
This course took me a lot of time and effort. But the professor  Balaji S. Srinivasan  is very clear. He actually tells you everything you need to know to accomplish the assignments. You won't come out of this course and be able to start a startup business  but you have your ass covered about a lot of things you do need to know if you do anything at this realm. especially from the tech side. I see some concepts from this course returning. And I do like tutorials. Not less important  I have less patience than most people for things that bore me. I cannot for example complete networking classes when they delved into concepts which can be summed very quickly. This class is very straight-forward given you are willing to put the effort and get the most of it. I don't think you should know Linux to well  I knew it very basically. I recommend this class to anyone who is interested about CS or Startup Engineering (Technically I thought it would be harder you should at-least have one preliminary intro to computing course the best one is MIT's edx 6..00 and Udacity's one is pretty fun also.

Content-wise  the course was quite interesting  combining a general introduction to startups and their economics with some technical backgrounds about how to bootstrap it and create a first concept.

Probably it is more targeted for non-technical or less-technical startupers-willing-to.,7,Completed,Mashimo,3 years  11 months ago
Good  frantic paced introduction to getting a startup going  but I think it should be either longer or split into 2 courses  as there are 2 main areas: \- Technical side is great and goes into the detailed tasks of building a site \- Business side - which covers (some of) the marketing  funding. I completed the technical assignments but did not have a project ready to market and try and get investors.,7,Completed,Duncan Murray,4 years ago

This class claims no prerequisites other than an intro-level knowledge of CS   but you'll have a much easier time if you come into it knowing certain things  like the Linux command line and emacs. The entire course is structured around  using a specific set of tools (Amazon Web Services  linux  emacs  node.js  heroku  GitHub) and following along with very long sets of instructions to get  a basic crowdsourcing site online using those tools. In the early goings  the  course can be pretty frustrating if you don't already have some familiarity  with linux  screen  Git and emacs. Otherwise  you'll have to spend a  significant amount of effort learning simple keyboard commands to get  anywhere. Once you learn those basic nut and bolts  the rest of the course is  mostly a matter of following a series of simple steps that are mostly spoon  fed to you.     Startup Engineering is probably a bit overly ambitious and tries  to introduce too many different topics all at once  which can leave students  scratching their heads and following along with instructions to complete  homeworks without necessarily knowing what they are actually doing. I think  the main issue people are having is that the course plays out more like an  extended tutorial or series of resources than an actual course. The video  lectures are extremely brief and not particularly insightful: all they do is  go through the lecture PDFs which are 30-50 page  detailed info dumps on  various topics related to the tech stack they are using and business start-  ups. They are a useful resources  but they take an enormous amount of time to  go through in detail  since they have links to other resources that themselves  take hours and hours to look through. It also seems that the main lecturer is  likely too busy to make comprehensive video lectures  since they are so short  and usually late.     In short  there is a ton of useful material here for a  motivated self-learner to sift through  but it lacks focus and engaging video  lectures.    I give this course 2.5 out of 5 stars: below average.,6,Taking Now,Greg Hamel,2 years  8 months ago
I think this class may have bitten off more than it can chew. It tries to cover everything from awk and sed to the yearly revenue of biotech companies  but it doesn't really succeed in teaching any of it. I've had to go elsewhere to learn how to create a website or start a business. The lecture videos were late and sporadic  so I ended up stumbling through each homework assignment without feeling like I actually understood it. The lecture notes should be in the dictionary under the term 'infodump'. They're filled with lots of great info  but they're in giant PDF files and not structured in a way that allows students to easily digest the material. Concepts should be introduced one at a time  allowing students to master each before moving on. If that means there's not enough time to cover everything  then either make more clear prerequisites  or split some material into its own course. There's a lot of potential here for a great class  but in its first run  it failed to capitalize.,3,Completed,No one of consequence,4 years  4 months ago
"I'm a software developer who enrolled in this course to get a taste of an unfamiliar technology stack. I am dropping this course even though I've successfully completed other MOOCs and was more excited about this one than any others. We are in week 6 of the course. All the homework was released close to on schedule  but we have only had 2 weeks of videos and 2 weeks where the lectures were released in pdf form. The schedule has been slipped by a week to fix this but I am very doubtful that 4 weeks of video are going to spring up in the next 4 days getting us back on track. The lecture content that has been presented has been good  not very consistent in its granularity  but worth watching/reading. The assignments are what concerns me that this course may not be good even in its second run. I use assignments in MOOCs to hack my brain into thinking it's under pressure to learn stuff. Even though I'm fully aware your grade in MOOCs is meaningless  it gamifies the situtation enough to motivate me. Unfortunately most of the assignments in this course are just walkthroughs. You don't need to understand what you're doing to complete them. And then at the end  all you submit is a permalink to the github commit of your work. You get the marks as long as what you submit looks like a github permalink. It's possible they're going to actually run tests on that stuff down the track  but that gives people no chance to improve if it turns out they made mistakes. So much for Coursera's ""mastery learning""! The whole thing is very demotivating. Contrast with EdX's SAAS course  where I just did the assignment for the week on rails. You are told to make some changes to an app you are given  but not how to make them. Then you submit a link to a heroku app you have deployed. Automated tests are run against the app and you are told which ones failed so you know what you still need to work on. That actually involves learning something  and gives a feeling of achievement when you get the marks. You may say this course is designed for self-motivated learners  well sure  if you go off on your own bat and learn node and bootstrap and what have you  you will learn heaps. But you don't need to enroll in the course to do that! I will probably enroll in the second iteration of this course  if there is one  to see whether it's improved enough to bother with. If it has  I will update this review!",2,Dropped,Amy Wilson,4 years  6 months ago

R Programming is a remake of Computing for Data Analysis  another course offered on Coursera by the same instructor. This course covers R basics such as R data types and objects  reading and writing data  control flow  functions  scoping  dates  loops  debugging tools  simulation and code profiling. The slides and lectures are a bit smoother than Computing for Data Analysis but the content is mostly the same. This course has good information but suffers from a lack of instructor face time and heavy use of static slides with voiceovers  which are less engaging than videos of instructors actually running the commands they are talking about. Additionally  there are no in- lecture quizzes or interactive exercises to help you absorb the material as you go along. If you want to get as much out of the course as you can  I recommend that you follow along with R Studio open on a second screen or window and try out commands discussed as you watch the videos. Overall  this is a decent intro to R  but it is not particularly engaging. Try R from Code School is a much more engaging  albeit brief  intro. If you take this course and want to apply what you've learned or want to learn R somewhere else consider MIT Analytics Edge on EdX  Duke’s Data Analysis and Statistical Inference on Coursera and Exploratory Data Analysis on Udacity. Each of these courses teach R basics in the context of learning other things like predictive modeling  statistics and data analysis.,6,Completed,Greg Hamel,3 years  10 months ago
This is a poor course  moreso because enough students have given this feedback  explained what could improve  but without any improvement. Mentors tow the line answering specific questions with abstract answers  somewhat as though discoursing philosophy in Socratic method.  Discussion forum culture would improve if Mentors were not going through existing discussion and redacting the code that was being posted (as though in fear of cheating) whilst full code answers are available elsewhere on the we.  Thus those who want to learn  have their posts redacts so that relevant code to the question is incomplete.  Cannot say how frustrated I am.  Terrible that this is only R programming class.,2,Taking Now,Helen Kres,4 months  1 week ago
Poor quality. The course instructor sounds thoroughly uninterested and spends the time simply reading out slides explaining very little  as well as frequently correcting himself  mumbling and littering the tutorials with ums and ahs  giving the impression of being utterly unprepared in his presentation. By the second week I found it very difficult to generate interest  and as a teacher myself increasingly annoyed by the instructor's style. He may be a great data scientist  but his teaching skills are non-existent.    Furthermore  the quiz questions bare little if any relation to what it learn in the tutorials  and regularly ask obscure theoretical questions regarding function calls and scoping rather than focussing on real practical skills with data manipulation. I have good knowledge of Javascript's closures  scoping etc. and so was able to muddle through  however  I dread to think how I would have coped had I not this experience prior to the course.    Having watched many high quality tutorials on Youtube for free  I am sufficiently irritated by this course and its nonsensical  outmoded and structuring and slapdash presentation to leave a review  which I very rarely do. For 50 euros a month and  with many students enrolled  I expect better quality.,4,Taking Now,Matt Cooper,4 months  3 weeks ago
I am really disappointed.  The assignments have nothing to do with the bad lectures.  Professor Peng  please.  Fix this.

Very hard to follow. This is not a class without programming experience. I agree with the comments their is a disconnect with the videos and assignments  Very disappointed,2,Taking Now,Student,10 months  1 week ago
I second the complaints regarding the disconnect from the lecture to the assignments  which I find inexplicable. I just can't conceive of any pedagogical justification to force students to go far outside the scope of the lectures to be able to complete assignments. The instructors might argue that getting information from everywhere else and trying to scrape it together and figure out what they are talking about is part of the real world. However  that would run contradictory to the purpose of having a course- efficiency of learning. I am sure if I just plopped myself down in an engineering library I could eventually learn as much engineering as a PhD in the field. The problem with that strategy is it would take someone triple (or more) the time doing things that way. The whole point of a school or a course is to increase efficiency of learning. So if you are going to bother to host a course and assign material then TEACH THE MATERIAL.   This course actually reminds me of why I never developed the computer skills I should have. I don't find the details of computer code particularly intellectually stimulating. But what's more  the people who do find it interesting are so often those who  if you try to ask them about it  fire back at you with weapons grade autism.   The second assignment was so foreign to anything taught in the lectures that it inspired me to try to google my way into understanding what is the social dysfunction of computer programmers. I still can't answer that of course  but my distraction led me to finding out that there is actually a contest held by programmers called the International Obfuscated C Code Contest in which programmers vie to see who can write the most opaque code imaginable. This course seems to have been designed by people who would participate in such a contest  who seem to want to put up unnecessary hurdles to understanding.,4,Taking Now,Student,1 year  7 months ago
Content is interesting.  instructions to to peer examination are insufficient and porely displayed  The last program on Hospital Statistics is fun and useful to promote the tool's value  Otherwise  I put too much time trying to understand to intricacies of GITHUB     As for my background:  BI specialist - It is managerial knowledge and skills assisted by computer software that are  the valuable information trasnsmitted to corporate executives  directors and managers. This is what I possess.    Cognos  Brio  B.O.  Microsrategy and Media are the tools used to implement the BI systems.    Furthermore  fielding and understanding corporate communication situations is key to implement a BI system. Asking questions and extremely listening are the first and foremost stepsbefore  designing and proposing a solution.     The basic  fundamental and inevitable rule to take into consideration is that  in truth  the medium shapes the mesage  and has the listener underdstand what the medium can contort  distort or at least change color.    The medium is the image  its pixels  the reprocessing of data  the voice and/or music supporting the raw information.    My work is to provide an uncluttered view of an event. Business Intelligence (BI) brings forth a dynamic temporal and spatial point of view that the system highlights.    My work deals with a hierarchy a directors  managers and executives that decide in a specific time-frame.     This ultimate action is that for which a BI syste is put into place.    R programing is a tool that contributes to the decision taking action here described.    That is what I do. Paul-André Dupuis,8,Taking Now,Student,1 year  5 months ago

I have a PhD in IT and have been teaching programming in many languages for the past 20 years. Despite this I really struggled with this course. The instructional design is simply terrible. There is virtually no relationship between the content and the assignments. The estimated workload per week is probably a quarter of what it should be. Sadly I bought the data science specialization package as a whole and this is one of the must have components. Otherwise I would have dropped the course already. I really believe the instructors need to rework this and add a SIGNIFICANT amount of scaffolding to lead the student from simple topics to more and more advanced ones. A lot of additional interactive assignments are needed and these should be substantially simpler and then gradually build up.,2,Taking Now,Student,1 year  10 months ago
"This is the first time I took a MOOC.     Overall  I found the ""R programming"" course interesting and I did learn things that I'm happy with. That said  I was a bit disapointed with the course because it's somehow outdated and poorly presented.    As other reviewers said  this course misses its target audience: if you already are a programmer you will find this course too easy and frustrating  at least until week 4 assignment in the very end.     OTOH  if you never had exposure or are new to programming  you'll probably hate this course and learn R in a hard and painful way.    Now  regarding more technical aspects:    - Slides: probably the worst. The look like they were written in 1990: plain text  small characters  no color  nothing. Why is that??    - Speaker: overall adds no value to the slides because he simply reads the text written in the slides. There are 1 or 2 videos where you can see him  which is much more engaging and motivating. Why just not have more videos like that? Also  if found the diction and the lecturer rythm of the speaker so-so ... sometimes he speaks too fast  and other times he makes noises with his mouth  etc. This could be improved.    - assignements: I really liked the peer reviewing part on week 3. Otherwise  assignments are quite dull  and not very challenging  at leat for weeks 1-3. Strangely  all the difficulty has been concentrated in week 4  which requires a LOT of efforts compared to the rest of this MOOC.     The last W4 assignement is also poorly presented (a pdf  as if you were takin an examp in college in 1994) and has misleading comments. Some of the text is vague  and the data is poorly documented and hardly understandable. I fould myself struggling for hours just to understand what was I exactly supposed to do. I do understand that the last assigment is supposed to be a ""real situation"" project  but the overall lack of clarity really adds no value in the end. It would have been much more interesting to have the audience purely focus on the R programming language and have a sexier project (counting heart attack death rates? how sexy is that..).    Finally  there are few if none to mention (at least in the slides) of some popular R packages like ggplot2  data.table  ... which really are what's used in production these days.    Also  for the validation of the assignments  if would have been clever to have a test set instead of asking the user to copy/paste random outputs of his own programmed functions. Indeed  the user has no way to know which errors he might have done in his code but to see he failed for the quizz (not my case  but if you don't know programming you probably will fail).    Lastly  it would be nice to have at least a cheat sheet or a pdf summary of the mooc in the end.

Prior to taking this course  the only experience I had with R was from an introductory statistics course I had taken at my university years ago. We had very few R assignments  so my exposure was limited. That said  this course was a good way to start. I do think it tried to cram a lot into one course  and I frankly forgot a lot of what I had learned. Nonetheless  I am aware of what is possible in R  and it has been a lot easier for me to come back to R when I needed to use it for one of my university courses.

The videos in the course are helpful as well as the slides.  The problems come when its time to turn do the assignments.  The assigned work is vague at best with very little descriptions of how its supposed to be turned in.  In fact without examples of finished work you will never figure out what they want.    When it comes time to submit assignments you must figure out a): how to get a user name and password for the submission process (its not your login name and password but registered or given else where) b): how many parts to turn in and what consists of a 'part' of the assignment anyway (they don't tell you).

Horrible.    I just gave up on watching lectures. There is no point on watching them considering that they are basically the instructor reading the slides with minimal extra information.    And the assignments are completely unrelated to the lectures  being quite a bit hard.     I don't know if I'll continue this specialization (obviously will finish this course).

Absolutely terrible and pointless class.    You need to be familiar with programming before taking this course  or you need to have a huge amount of spare time. The course material is disjointed and unrelated to the assignments. They should tell you to take an introductory R programming course before taking this introductory R programming course.  What they should have done is shown you some simple R code and how they are used to extract subsets and perform calculations. This is where you should start. At least if they show you the basics  you become familiar with the concepts and can work towards more complex analytical goals  but the instructors seem to be oblivious to this fact.    The fact is  you will learn very little about data science if you take this course.,2,Dropped,Student,2 years  5 months ago

This is a good course for people with some programming experience who want an introduction to R as a data science tool. It's tough sledding for those without that background.     The material isn't spoon-fed  so be prepared to google and use Stack Overflow. The course positioning seems to create mismatches. If you plan to learn data science without programming  this course will disappoint. But that's probably not a good plan anyway.    The exercise on lexical scoping seems out-of-sequence. It isn't required for effective use of R in many data analysis contexts. The assignment instructions could be improved. Peer assessments can be a little problematic. When newb students review work they don't understand  they sometimes get it wrong. There's an extra credit opportunity that compensates.,8,Completed,Michael Devereux,2 years  5 months ago

The course claims to be for beginners but assignments are way to difficult for that level and take an awful lot of time. Tasks in assignments are also unrelated to the video lectures. If you are a total beginner  I recommend starting with doing a full 15-lesson swirl assignment  then do all 4 weeks of lectures and quizzes  and then go the first programming assignment. Doing swirl first will save lots of time trying to figure out things by yourself  and watching all video lectures first is almost necessary  as I used a function in week1 assignment that was only introduced in week 3 lectures. Overall  the course helped me to get things started and forced me to sit long hours to learn but I definitely learnt more from Stack Overflow trying to solve assignment problems than from the course itself. It may be easier for people with previous programming experience but if you're a newbie be prepared to get frustrated.,6,Completed,Student,2 years  6 months ago
My first course that actually just focused on programming in R  as opposed to using R for statistical analysis. I have no education whatsoever in computer science/programming so needless to say that some of the concepts/homeworks were quite painful for me...however I felt that it was worth understanding because you come away with such a better idea of R's capabilities and usefulness  which are of course totally transferable to other courses that require R.,6,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago

This innovative  challenging and rewarding course approaches a traditional  linear-algebra curriculum from a computational perspective. Students write  procedures implementing key mathematical concepts  and apply these to  interesting labs that have you changing the perspective of a photograph   dabbling in machine learning  and writing a simple search engine. The lectures  are well-organized and the written materials are superb. Note  however  that  this is not primarily a programming course -- the point of the programming is  to understand and apply the math  those looking for a Python introduction as  such might prefer other options. In fact  because solutions to the programming  assignments are not provided and code cannot be shared or posted  your coding  skills may not improve much. And if you’re new to Python  expect to turn  frequently to external tutorials and resources. Those with no prior exposure  to linear algebra may also find themselves playing catch-up given the fast  pace and abstract focus of the lectures. The course emphasizes proofs at the  expense of explained examples and illustrative applications – great for math  lovers but maybe not for linear algebra neophytes. Overall  while the  presentation moves at a brisk march and the workload is considerable  those  willing to devote the time will find the pieces fitting together into a unique  learning experience. The course as given was actually only the first 8 weeks  of the12-week course taught at Brown  and a mini-course covering the remaining  material is planned. Future versions will hopefully cover the entire  curriculum in a single session.,8,Completed,Steven Frank,2 years  6 months ago

Likes:  * Teaching math via programming is right up my alley. I hope to find more courses that do the same.  * Prof and staff were active in the forums.  * It seems that most of the grader problems reported during previous sessions have been sorted out. There were still a few outstanding issues  but staff was quick to either fix them or suggest a way around them.  * Lots of exercises    Dislikes:  * Videos. The prof stands in front of the PowerPoint and reads from the slides. I'm not typically one to skip the lectures and read the course notes  but I found there was little reason to watch the videos in the end.  * Provided Python modules. I often found them frustrating to work with. As an example  the vector and matrix classes include labels for their columns and rows. This adds extra overhead when creating and manipulating those objects – if you want to multiply a matrix M by a vector v  i.e. M*v  not only does vector v need to have the same number of rows as M does columns  as one would expect  but the labels of the rows of v have to match the labels of the columns of M. There never seemed to be any payoff for this added complexity.    Suggestions:  * I think there's a missed opportunity for visualisations. There are lots of compelling examples of linear algebra applications in 2-D and 3-D that could be rendered to the screen.  * Drop the column/row labels for matrices and vectors.,6,Completed,Peter Moldovia,2 years  10 months ago
Unlike the previous 14 reviews  this is about the second iteration of the class. From what I can tell  the professor has made a fair amount of changes addressing some of the complaints in the other reviews (and the 14 reviews averaged 4 stars  so the complaints aren't that major). As this is only my first week  I set the star ratings for content and instructor are set to average until I can better assess the course (and whether I need to look at any videos or not). I've taken python and linear algebra MOOCs before  which is good because this class takes a lot of time to do well in. I see that the professor has upped the time estimates from 4-5 hours/week in the first iteration of this MOOC to 7-10 hours per week for this one. Maybe 7-10 is OK if you want to get 60% on every single assignment (a requirement for a certificate)  but if you want to shoot higher  most people will need even more time. I'm only finishing up the first week of assignments  I've watched no lectures and I'm guessing I'm up to 15+ hours. I like that a community TA has set up a thread for each problem in the assignments. An even better improvement on that would be to also include a link on the assignments page to such a structure (e.g. the Pattern Discovery in Data Mining MOOC on Coursera has links on a weekly page which lists each video and a button linking to a subforum for that video). If you want to be able to get a certificate while missing or not completing most of some assignments  you are out of luck. I've never seen that in a MOOC before. Since I want to do very well in this course  I'm biting the bullet and spending a lot more time than I had planned  to do this. I think for MOOCs which are taken mostly by people who are non-full time college students  the professor should split this up into multiple MOOCs so he can lengthen the course time and reduce the weekly work load.,6,Taking Now,Jeff Winchell,2 years  11 months ago

This course is a pretty good attempt at combining Maths theory with practical programming - I learned a lot about Python comprehensions  and a fair bit about Linear Algebra. It gives a background on the maths and appears to finish where the Machine Learning course begins - though I felt I could apply the learning from ML theory a lot easier than from this course. PROS \- great boot camp which forces you to really write correct Python code \- learning the Maths theory and applying it in code each week \- grader allows multiple attempts with no obvious time limits (necessary though) \- active forums \- fun secondary (still mandatory) assignments - I loved the one on changing the perspective of a photo CONS \- Overly picky autograder  often rejects correct Python code because it needs to be written in a certain way (possibly because they force you to use comprehensions in a certain way) \- lots of homework: 2-3 short programming assignments every week \- lectures could use some more comments around applications of the theory being used  rather than just the maths theory followed by occasional code. The secondary weekly assignments should have been referred to frequently in the videos  to reinforce why this particular bit was useful Overall  I am glad I did this course - it was very challenging and time consuming but well worth the effort.,8,Completed,Duncan Murray,4 years  5 months ago
"This is a course with a lot of potential  which unfortunately it completely fails to live up to. Video lecture quality is mediocre at best. The instructor lectures in front of a large screen  and frequently will be standing in front of the notes on the screen. The lectures themselves are very dry  abstract  and ""mathy""  which is to be expected for the subject  so I'm not counting this against the class. The homework load is heavy  which would be okay if the instructions were always clear and unambiguous  which they are not. For example  a two-part homework problem would require that you assign values to two python variables  but the variables would not be named in the instructions  so you had to guess which variable should hold which answer. The autograder has a number of problems. Feedback from the autograder was generally unhelpful. For example  there was a four-part problem where the autograder would only respond ""Incorrect""  without telling you which parts of the problem were wrong. In another case  the autograder would accept an answer of the form ""a + b""  but not of the equivalent form ""b + a"". Ambiguities in the homework and problems with the autograder are the sort of thing I expect might get ironed out if the class is offered again. Course staff does not seem to be actively monitoring the forums  and a blanket prohibition on posting code to the forums makes it very difficult for students to help each other. But the absolutely unforgivable sin  the one which prompts the low rating I have given  is that the instructor will not be posting sample solutions to the assignments after the deadlines have passed. If you can't figure out a problem on your own  you are completely out of luck. The way you learn to write better code is by looking at other peoples code  and this class does not allow you to do this at all.",4,Dropped,Brock Sides,4 years  5 months ago
I did have some background with basics of Linear Algebra. The promised computer science applications of this course is what I signed up for. Also  I had just started learning Python  so the fact that Python was the language for this course was an added bonus. In a nutshell  the course did deliver on that promise  but failed on almost all other aspects of the course. Pros: \- Rigorous  non-trivial assignments. Makes you think about foundational first- principles of linear algebra. \- It shows the power to Python as especially suited for numerical applications. I am really glad that this course used Python instead of something like Matlab/Octave. \- Good call on splitting the course into two parts. The advanced follow-up course will be offered sometime in the future. I think this was a very good call. Otherwise the fraction of people dropping out of this course would have been much higher. Cons: \- Grader. Oh  the grader. Absolutely ruthless grader. A course which is supposed to take 4-5 hours a week ends up taking 7-10 hrs because you are trying to debug some really mundane grader related issues. In the process  you're learning neither Linear Algebra nor Python. Also  the fact that feedback given when you submit an incorrect answer are absolutely useless. I expect a CS course to be a little more foolproof. However  I think this issue won't be as bad in the next versions of the course. \- Prof. Klein  though very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the course material  is just reading off of the slides most of the time. In fact  I ended up reading the proofs of the lemmas myself directly off of the slides to save time. \- The programming knowledge required to complete the course if ill-advised. Beginner programmers will find it hard to cope with the rigour of the course. So  beware! All in all  I am happy with the course  but I wish I had signed up for the second offering of the course instead of the debut offering. Would have saved me a considerable amount of time.,7,Completed,Karthik Puthraya,4 years  5 months ago
"Prior Experience: Took several linear algebra courses at university and have python programming experience If it is a pure Linear Algebra course  I would not enroll into it in the first place. I am curious to find out how matrices and vectors can be applied to computer science problems. Like: 1) Interesting Labs - Real application of matrix and vector calculation to Computer Science problems. Use dot product to find out if politicians cast same or different votes to a legislative bill. Use matrices to scale  translate  rotate and color scale an image. Instructor even provides python code to display the image in web browser to see the effect. 2) The discussion forum is very engaging. Tons of positive comments from staff and fellow colleagues. When I get stuck  I always find good advice in existing posts. Dislike: 1) Brutal autograder - If solution does not yield the expected result  autograder returns a generic yet unhelpful message  ""Sorry  incorrect!"". I would expect an informative response from a program written by a Computer Science professor. I never imagine to put Mathematics and Computer Science in the same sentence.

"I took a linear algebra class in college (a decade ago.) We didn't cover much in the course so I didn't get much out of. As I like programming  this seemed like a good opportunity to actually learn Linear Algebra. And it was. I know a lot more now than when I finished the course in college. I bought the class book so I can read the 4 weeks of material that weren't covered in class. (The book is very similar to the lecture so you don't really need it.) Every week  there were homeworks and labs. The labs were applications of the concepts. Week 1 was a lot of python questions. I think it was used as a combination review and weeder week. Because you really do need to be very comfortable in Python to handle the rest of the course. People were helpful in the forums when you got stuck and they were well moderated. The TAs were knowledgeable and monitored the forums as well. This was the first session of the class so us students also served the purpose of being beta testers for the autograder than analyzes your homeworks/labs for the class and the professor's website. It could stand for some improvement. I also felt like the assignments could have used more detail of the output format and examples. I wound up writing pyunit tests for myself to test and sharing them in the forums. I liked the professor's philosophy of ""don't worry if you gets stuck on a question  you'll still pass.' Unfortunately as a computer programmer  I program I can't write is like a puzzle calling out to me. I went back to them until I got them all. Overall  it was a good class though.",8,Completed,Jeanne Boyarsky,4 years  5 months ago
This course was criticized in the forums for the amount of assignment work. I found the time taken on assignments varied from 10 minutes per week to 8 hours per week! If you saw the clever solution it was often one or two lines of code  if not then you could be stuck for an hour. All the puzzles were solvable  and none were that tricky (once you'd spotted your silly mistake!). If you enjoy puzzles and challenge that you've no idea how to solve (especially if you've had no exposure to Python before) then you'll like this. Sometimes the maths will be clear  but expressing it in Python will frustrate - other times it'll be maths that needs decoding. I loved this course. Completing it felt like an accomplishment.,10,Completed,AJT P,4 years  5 months ago
What you will get out of this course some knowledge of python list comprehensions An understanding of the basics of linear algebra A vague idea how to apply linear algebra to real problems Good problem solving skills Why you might not want to take it: if you just want to learn linear algebra if you just want to learn programming Summary: This class isn’t designed to purely linear algebra as roughly half your time will be spent writing code and trying to understand what problem is asking for. The fickle grader forces you to think about the problem the way it wants. Which may result less in expanding your mind and more frustration. If your goal is just linear algebra then a good text on the subject or Gilber Strangs MIT class is will serve you better. That being said this perspective is unique and is a amazing complement to a tradtional class. Final Verdict: I would take this class but prepare by running through Learn python the hard way. Before. I have a hunch future updated versions of this class will be Amazing and lack the grader complications that sometimes dragged down this run through.,7,Completed,Drew Verlee,3 years  11 months ago
This has been my first coursera course so I can compare with others but I can only say that it has exceded my expectations a lot.

I started my Mooc adventure with Andrew Ng's ground breaking  wonderful Machine Learning class and now pause after Philip Klein's equally ground breaking  equally wonderful course on coding up linear algebra. I say pause as I imagine I will be returning to Moocs in the future as the need and opportunity arise. Using code to teach mathematics is a brilliant way to bring a traditionally dry subject to life. I think this approach will prove invaluable in both high school and university mathematics in the future. A big challenge for educators is to get more people to code so that this new approach to learning is open to them.

Pattern discovery in data mining is the first course in a new 5-part data mining specialization offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign through Coursera. Keeping with the trend of other specialization courses  pattern discovery in data mining spans 4 weeks and will likely be offered again each month or two after the first offering. The course covers a range of methods for finding different types of patterns in data  such as association rules and patterns in graphs. Grading is based exclusively on 4 weekly quizzes. I was excited to see the new data mining specialization come up on Coursera to kick off 2015  but unfortunately  pattern discovery in data mining is a dull  poorly executed information dump. Besides an interesting topic  there’s not much going for this course. In the lectures  the professor reads information off dense slides and his delivery is more confusing than instructive. The slides  video and sound are of decent quality  but the explanations are not clear and while I normally don't have an issue with foreign accents  the professor's English made things harder to understand. To make things worse  there are few instructive in lecture quizzes and no activities or programming assignments. A course about data mining should have programming assignments or activities that let students interact with the concepts to reinforce learning. Pattern discovery in data mining is a disappointing start to the data mining specialization  that suffers from poor instruction quality and lack of illustrative assignments. Taking this course is like a data mining problem in and of itself: you have to spend a lot of time deciphering the lectures to uncover useful information.,3,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  11 months ago
I liked the way I was able to learn more about the newest trends in pattern discovery  but  as with other courses  there was too much theory  and too little practice. However  it was a fun experience  but I hope in the second iteration that the ratio of the programming assignments and the theoretical descriptions of various algorithms and papers will be equal.,6,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,1 year  5 months ago
This course has some nice content but the presentation is very boring. The instructor does take a good time and effort to provide examples of the principal topics and algorithms.

As a creator of some of the techniques explained in this course  the instructor clearly has deep knowledge about the material he presents. However  he is not a teaching specialist  so learning the material is somewhat of a challenge (somewhat more so for those unfamiliar with east Asian accented English.) For those having problems learning solely by the videos provided  I recommend reading the free chapters from his book  which the course is based on. It is good that the instructor has setup forum subforums  such that there is a subforum for each video in the class. I wish there was programming in the class as I find that often helps me to better learn the material. The material is somewhat abstract so you have to concentrate more in this MOOC.,8,Taking Now,Jeff Winchell,2 years  11 months ago
Videos and quizzes were very good. Quizzes were somewhat easy. As you could  take them few times  i maxed them all without much thinking.

But the course lacks some more ambitious project to engage listener little bit  more  in my opinion.,8,Completed,kr strug,2 years ago
The videos are very nice  and the professor is very good at explaining things in context. I really liked the introduction on version control  and the explanation of parallel computing was very well done and not rushed through. Too bad for the programming assignment  which had no evalutation at all  and were not even on coursera  but on the external course website. The lack of any form of evalutation and of a certificate discouraged efforts on that side  so I feel like I learned the theory but I would not be able to parallelize a real code. I hope they will put an autograder or a peer assestment in the next offerings of the course  but I fear that they will just keep repeting everything without any change and without any interaction with the students,6,Completed,Mizar83 .,4 years  5 months ago
The lecturer hypnotized me in every video.   The content is hard to follow and out of context at times. Too much reading out theory and no application.

Text Mining and Analytics is the fourth course in the Data Mining specialization offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne through Coursera. Text Mining builds upon the second course in the specialization  Text Retrieval and Search Engines. Course topics include mining word relations  topic discovery  text clustering  text categorization and sentiment analysis. The course lists programming proficiency (especially in C++) and knowledge of probability and statistics. Keeping with the system established by other data mining specialization track courses  grading is based entirely upon 4 multiple choice quizzes with 10 questions apiece. You only get one attempt at the quizzes.      Text Mining and Analytics is information-packed. Each week has 2.5 to 4 hours of lecture content in video segments that generally range from 10 to 20 minutes. The videos quality is satisfactory but the explanations and content on the slides could be a bit clearer. Despite the long videos  there are no comprehension questions or exercises to interact with during or after lecture segments to reinforce learning. By the time you reach the quiz at the end of the unit  you may find yourself having to go back review certain videos to answer the questions. There is an optional programming assignment.      Text Mining and Analytics covers many useful data mining topics  but it has too much lackluster video content for its own good. I can’t help but feel like a better course would have been able to condense the videos down to cover the same topics more clearly in half the time  leaving room for more quizzes and exercises. This course could serve as useful as reference material but students watching straight through may find a lot of information going in one ear and out the other.      I give Text Mining and Analytics 2.5 out of 5 stars: Mediocre.,4,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  6 months ago
This course was a major disappointment for me. Everything was bad: content  presentation  evaluation  programming assignments. You name it.    I will start with the content of the course. Text Mining is a very exciting area of computer science getting a lot of attention these days  for some reason the algorithms and ideas that are being used today and are the state of the art weren't covered in this course. There's nothing about things such as deep learning  wordvec  glove  recurrent neural networks or LSTM that are the most important tools used today for natural language processing. So I think the content is outdated and I felt I was getting a review of things the instructor likes instead of things really used in the field.    Next the presentation: really terrible. The instructor dances around formulas and papers without a single working example to check how things work or any attempt to simplify the topics or explain the most important concepts  just references to papers and reading out loud formulas.     The evaluation is also problematic you have only 1 chance at each quiz so effectively you have four exams. This wouldn't be a problem if the lectures contained anything remotely similar to what the quizzes ask. If you are going to give students one attempt at each quiz you need to at least do some examples of excercises in your lectures.    The programming assignment was the cherry on the cake  confusing  badly prepared and didn't make any sense. The META system used is really terrible to work with and is a tool that as far as I know is not used at all in the real world. There are plenty of interesting things and tools to use in this area but for some reason META was chosen. I think that was a very bad choice.    At the end I completed all quizzes and passsed the course and felt I learned almost nothing and the very few things I remember about the lectures are things that I know won't be useful in the real world.    I would have given it 0 stars but I have no such an option.,2,Completed,Richard Taylor,2 years  7 months ago
I was very happy when I heard about the course because it was my first MOOC in text-mining.     The course contents are too vague and the instructor is not suitable for teaching. His voice is monotonous and boring and he is very difficult to follow. The course lacks context and appetite wetting and you don't know what are you going to do with these algorithms. You as a student cannot see the big picture.The programming assignment was fun but did not help learning the course contents.    I will complete the course just because the topic of this course is very important and it is difficult to learn this topic from books  either.

This course is the first in Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization on coursera. The specialization is really promising .The instructors did a great job of designing nice engaging courses.They carefully alleviated the problems of existing courses. Instead of PowerPoint  they used films to teach subjects. Instead of one voice  you hear the voice of different people. The use of Anaconda allows the student to get rid of installation and package management troubles at the very beginning. Instead of uploading your code and document  you post assignments on your blog. This minimizes the trouble of uploading and technical issues. In addition  you can show your posts to other people later. Last but not least  there are no quizzes to take up your time. You do four short assignments and it is done.   In a nutshell  this is a carefully designed specialization. Highly recommended.,8,Completed,Hamideh Iraj,1 year  11 months ago

I will start with the cons then get to the pros: This lectures are rough  even painful at times. It often seemed that Dr. Howe put minimal effort into preparing the videos  he regularly caught errors in his slides and often seemed as though he was thinking about what to say for the first time. He frequently attempted to cover too much in a hurry. I especially found the lectures on NoSQL  statistics  and machine learning difficult to follow (despite a background in statistics and machine learning). Also  if you only do the required assignments  the workload is very unbalanced. The first assignment is very challenging and time consuming. The second is easier. And the rest of the assignments require little time commitment. Now this can be okay  because there were optional assignments you could use to fill in this extra time. Pros: The class does expose you to the main topics of data science. You definitely do not come out an expert in these topics. But you at least gain familiarity with them. The assignments were pretty much all valuable  the most so probably being the Kaggle assigment. Kaggle is where many a data scientist honed their chops. This class gets you started competing in Kaggle competitions. If you really want to learn how to do data science at home  spend time competing at Kaggle. The forums are great. I personally benefited enormously by two threads  one by the President of Kaggle and another by a Kaggle champion  in which they answered any data science questions the students had for them. Very knowledgeable and willing to help. Thank you to them. Overall: If you are interested in data science  take the course. Despite its shortcomings  you will find value in it. Additionally  you got the sense that one of the main reasons for the issues of the course was that it was rushed to get out. I imagine in future iterations  these wrinkles will begin to get ironed out. Don't expect to become an expert in data science from this course  but do expect to have a better feel for what the field of data science is  and some direction as you embark on becoming a data science expert.,8,Completed,Esteban Afonso,4 years  7 months ago

This was my first Coursera course  so I'm a bit nostalgic and emotional about it. However  I did enjoy it quite a lot. It was a nice blend of theoretical models and practice  but it should say that it requires previous experience in Python and SQL  otherwise it could be tough for a beginner. The Tableau visualization was fun  but other assignments could be improved by adding tutorials and more time to grasp these concepts. Kaggle competition was a huge deal  and it should stay mandatory.

"This class should be called: ""Introduction to my disorganized world of Data Science and the hidden grading system"" This instructor should be ashamed of himself. It is one thing to have a lot of mistakes in the first iteration of a course (assuming he has never taught this before  outside of a MOOC). But I'm taking this course the second time and there are still major mistakes in it. Although the professor is from a world class university in Seattle  a city with the highest reputation for customer service anywhere  this professor shows disdain for customer service. Poor descriptions that make an assignment IMPOSSIBLE to fulfill are corrected by a TA  buried in some thread  but NEVER corrected in the assignment description  even after a week. Other missing information stays missing for months. The ""real world"" assignment was using this ""not ready for primetime"" website Coursolv which mostly seemed to be projects looking for people to do grunt work (nothing remotely resembling data science) for free. The big data assignment (using TB size data) seemed to require that you like Linux in order to figure out how to do it. They even warned you that you may not get through the setup/installation if you use Windows. What arrogance. 90% of the world is using Windows  even if this professor apparently dislikes it. The peer review assignments gave no indication (or gave contrary indications) on what rules people would use to assess you  so you could waste your time doing things that actually took points away from you. I got a 56% on one peer assessment  which is FAR lower than any peer assessment I've ever had in the 50+ MOOCs I've taken. The only 2 things I got out of this MOOC was realizing what I've been doing for decades was called ""data science"" (so I have a title ""upgrade"") and by having a mandatory assignment using kaggle.com I finally got myself to try out kaggles (which are cool  but you don't need this MOOC to find out... just go there and try them). If you can find another way to learn this material  do so. If you are a true hacker and like trying to solve the unsolvable  there will likely be good students to learn from. Much better experience than trying to learn from this instructor who cares far less about teaching than many of the students do.",1,Completed,Jeff Winchell,3 years ago
Introduction to Data Science is misleading title for this course because it is not introductory level and it does not have a sensible flow that builds from one week to the next as you would expect from an intro course. Instead  the course acts as more of a data science sampler that introduces new topics each week that often have little to do with material covered in previous weeks. Lecture topics include relational databases  relational algebra  SQL  MapReduce  No SQL  miscellaneous topics in statistics  machine learning  visualization and graph analytics. If that sounds like a disjointed smorgasbord of topics  it is. To make matters even more complicated  the programming assignments use three different languages: Python  R and SQL. This course is best suited for those who have some exposure to Python  R  SQL and statistics.         If you have the appropriate background knowledge  this course touches on many interesting topics and while the lecturer's delivery is not great  he is quite knowledgeable and the material usually isn't too hard to grasp. Although the homework assignments require different languages and may take you a while to complete  they are rewarding. For instance  you'll work with real Twitter data you capture from the net  implement MapReduce operations in Python and participate in a machine learning competition on Kaggle.com.         Introduction to data science is likely to be frustrating to those expecting a general intro to data science. The course jumps around too much and uses too many different tools to be a good first course in data science  but the breadth of topics covered and programming assignments make this course worth a look if you already have some exposure to data science or the tools the course uses. If nothing else  you can skip through the lectures and watch sections that are of particular interest to you.,6,Completed,Greg Hamel,3 years  5 months ago
Before I took this course I had enrolled to some similar ones such as Computing for Data Analysis  Learn to Program: The Fundamentals and Getting and Cleaning Data at Coursera. All of these were well organized  easy to catch up and with very good teachers. On the contrary  Intro to Data Science lacks all of these attributes. It is a course with too many and too long video lectures  which are badly build up and (sorry) very poorly explained by the professor. In addition  there is little connection between the lectures and the projects. The former is basicaly theoretical stuff and the later is very practical. To summarize  if you do not have a degree in Computer Science or a lot of experience programming do not enroll this course. And if you do  I am sure you will get bored during the lectures.

Rambling  error-filled lectures that really don't explain the material. You'll be left to figure it out on your own or by posting questions to the online forums. Instructor doesn't assume you know statistics  Python  and SQL  but you really do need to know them because the lectures are so poor. My girlfriend has a PhD and knows (and uses) statistics and agrees that he's a poor instructor. Not worth the trouble unless you already know most of the material  but then why bother with this course? Worst course I've ever taken on Coursera. Coursera should be embarrassed by this offering. The others were far better.,2,Completed,Student,4 years  7 months ago
Fantastic course  but there are some week points: Good: Bill Howe is knowledgeable and his insight is worth taking the course just for this alone. I understood more about database theory then ever before. I got into the internals of Big data and I loved it. Very flexible course and assignment structure. If you have a Big data project and want to run with it as a part of the course you can do this! Bad: The assignment workload is crazy. I found myself spending hours just getting my python programs to compile. However once done I found my programming skills were pushed to the limit (amatuer C++ programmer delving into Python). Allot of breath  with a fair bit of depth. This is not an easy course. Cecillia Aragon's lectures on visualisation are fantastic too. I loved them and the content within. Great course  Tough but well worth doing.,9,Completed,colin mcdermott,4 years  4 months ago

Poor communication from Professor and staff.

"# Very nice course for beginning in this area. # Introduces you to map-reduce  AWS  ML libraries in python and R and basic info about ML algos. Also  tableau. # Introduces you to Kaggle by including a mandatory assignment of participating in an open competition. # Discussion forum is very active with AMA threads by experienced people on Kaggle. I agree that it's not very exhaustive and assignments are easy compared to other courses. But that's what the title says  it is an ""INTRODUCTION to data science"". One can build upon ideas learnt from here.",9,Completed,ashish bhutani,4 years  7 months ago
It had been a while since I actively programmed (in C  Java  and SQL). Other reviewers have mentioned the difficult nature of the content of the course  however  that was one of my favourite parts.

"As an introduction to the topic  I think the course works great. It covers an amazing number of topics  so it's really just skimming through it  but serves to know ""what's out there"" and start reseaching in the topic you are most interested on. I took the course as a Computer Science graduate (10 years out of college)  so I was very familiar with some of the material. However  I found interesting info in almost al lectures  and a couple of illuminating segments.",8,Completed,Nacho Castejón,4 years  6 months ago
The course was very disorganized  without clear passing conditions  and suffered changes along the way. Yet the content was very good as an introduction to data science  and there where some really interesting assignments such as matrix multiplication in SQL  or the Kaggle competitions. Overall  I think I took a lot of good things from the course  and I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic  provided we have enough self motivation to overcome the course's shortcomings. Hopefully any future iteration of the course will be improved.,7,Completed,Marjan Ček,4 years  6 months ago
I generally concur with many of the other reviews. For me  I still come down on the pro side. However  I had some degree of familiarity with the majority of the topics covered in the course--including a fair bit of programming experience--so I didn't have any trouble setting up the various environments required for the assignments. The only specific point that I found especially frustrating was auto-grader issues for the first assignment--which I assume will be corrected in future iterations. For me personally  I found the breadth of topics welcome as this gave me new insights into a number of different areas  a number of which I just had cursory knowledge of. That said  I can understand the frustration of many. The course was certainly a bit rough in terms of both content of individual lectures/assignments and overall flow. In several ways  it felt as if it petered out towards the end. The Tableau assignment  in particular  just seemed ill-conceived as it required proprietary Windows software. Overall  I think there's the core of a much better course here  albeit one that probably requires a better grounding in programming etc. than is obvious from the prereqs.,6,Completed,Gordon Haff,4 years  6 months ago
"This course started impressively  especially if you weren't familiar with Python and JSON. But much of the second half appeared random and made up as it went along  as if the lecturer seemed to lose interest. The ""guest"" lectures were not much more than advertorials and the final assignment using Tableau software also had a ""brought to you by our sponsor"" feel - was this an attempt to develop a Coursera revenue model? On the positive side  the discussion forums were very active and helpful. Numerous technical issues with assignment submission were frustrating but this can probably be be put down to the course being in beta mode and would probably be more streamlined if the course is run again. The programming assignments (Python  SQL  Mapreduce  Pig / AWS) were not particularly difficult in themselves but configuring environments to run them definitely provided a sense of achievement.",6,Completed,Student,4 years  7 months ago
Data Science in Real Life is the fourth and final course in the “Executive Data Science” specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The one-week course examines various steps in the data analysis process and contrasts ideal outcomes against the outcomes you are likely to experience in reality. Grading is based upon a few short multiple-choice quizzes.    The lecture videos are crisp and the professor does a good job explaining the topics without being overly technical. It does discuss some topics that you won’t fully appreciate without having hand-on experience doing data science projects  but it will help prepare you for some of the problems you might encounter. Like other courses in the Executive Data Science track  there’s not too much to dislike about this course other than its brevity and the limited depth at which topics can be covered in a one-week course.    Data Science in Real Life is nice  succinct overview of many of the challenges you are likely to face in data projects and suggestions for overcoming them. It is raises considerations that could be useful for both data analysts and managers.    I give Data Science in Real Life 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.,8,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  1 month ago
Building a Data Science Team is the second course in “Executive Data Science” specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. It is a one-week course that defines the different data science roles in an organization  what to look for in data scientists and strategies for managing and communicating with data scientists. The course has no prerequisites and grading is based on a handful of multiple-choice quizzes.    The content in Building a Data Science Team is similar to the first course in the specialization: it is geared toward a non-technical people who have to manage data scientists. The video quality is good and the instructor is personable  easy to understand and knowledgeable. There’s not too much to dislike about this course apart from its brevity. All of the courses in the Executive Data Science track are only a week long  so they can be completed in one or two learning sessions. This is not necessarily a bad thing: I find it refreshing to get a high-level overview of a topic in a short course  but it may not deliver the amount of content that paying students expect.    Building a Data Science Team is a good course for what it is: a succinct primer how to assemble and manage a data science team.    I give this course 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.,8,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  1 month ago
Excellent 8 week college introductory course to probability  from a mathematics perspective.  First edition of the course finished April 2015.  The perspective is critical as the course is somewhat more difficult than a course on introductory statistics  requiring the ability to manipulate equations  with just a smidgen of calculus.  The instructor is very passionate about the subject and put together an absolutely amazing set of numerous videos  one of the best I have yet seen for MOOCs.  The videos included interesting historical references.  The videos are somewhat verbose but easily addressed by watching at accelerated speeds.  Certificate provided  65% passing and 90% distinction.  Course statistics were provided that showed the average weekly score on the homeworks was ~70%.  ~42000 enrolled  but by the end of the course only about 600 students were still submitting homeworks.  Discussion forum very active and well supported at the beginning but tailed off as the class participation declined.  The instructor was very active throughout.  No quizzes or exams or in-video questions or peer assessments  just seven weekly homeworks each consisting of 7-8 multiple choice questions with 2 attempts  solutions provided 24 hours after the 24 hour 50% penalty deadline.  I am a well experienced engineer and managed to barely achieve a perfect score  however  there were ~10 problems that I solved by means outside of the course  primarily simulation.  Materials released on a weekly basis.  In my opinion  the homeworks were short of problems as compared to other MOOCs and the lecture materials usually did not provide more than one example of each concept.  A few of the homework problems were ambiguously stated  so the 2nd attempt came in handy.  In my opinion  the shortage of worked out examples was the only significant shortcoming of the course.  I highly recommend the course and would take it again.,8,Completed,Dale anon456,2 years  9 months ago
This course have the potential to be a great course. To get the most out of this course you should have some background knowledge in programming  machine learning  information theory  electrical circuits  bioelectricity or else you might get overwhelmed by the complex math used in the course. But if that is not a problem for you then it is a very inspirational course. I join to get new ideas for brain inspired AI techniques  and I got a couple of new ones while learning how the brain process information. The biggest problem holding the course back from being a great course is that they do not provide the lecture slides for download. Citing copyright problems as the reason. I find that access to the slides is the most important thing of a MOOC after the lecture videos. Also the course only had the 2 lectures working on it not a team like most MOOCs  it showed but those 2 did a fantastic job. I think that next it runs most of the problem will be solved and if you have the math skills and the interest I will recommend it.,7,Completed,Equanimous Creativity,4 years  8 months ago
This course was a huge inspiration  but it required a lot of prerequisites in high-level mathematics and programming. Even though I've passed the course with high marks  the programming exercises took a lot of time  and the quizzes weren't easy. It's not an introductory course  but the first few lectures ought to be enough if you're looking for a glance into what CN is. However  I'd recommend giving more practical introduction to certain theoretical approaches studied  for example  to combine the formula given in the slides with ways how to calculate them in Python and similar. I'm giving it one star more because the lecturers had done a huge job by themselves.,8,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,2 years  4 months ago
Pretty good course  with a very nice idea to split the delivery between different professors (for foreigners - it's a great opportunity to develop audition skills  as all the teachers have different accents). I especially liked staffing and performance management  but I think  it depends on the practical issues you struggle now. If you are involved in building international teams - you will also like collaboration part by Martine Haas.    Generally - very positive impression. Not ground-breaking  but at the moment it's the best course of HR analytical tools and insights I found anywhere.,8,Completed,Dmytro Sawochkin,1 year  10 months ago
I audited the course. This is a high-level non-technical course. You will get a general idea about topics in people analytics.

This is a very good conceptual course about logistic regression with videos not exceeding two hours per week. The instructor has mastery over the subject and he explains the details of the algorithm.   This course teaches stata which is the reason I am not doing the assignments because I am not going to spend time learning a new tool. I wish the course was teaching R. In that case it would be a five star one.  If you are practicing epidemiology   it is a must study course for you.,8,Taking Now,Hamideh Iraj,2 years  7 months ago

A Crash Course in Data Science is a succinct  one-week overview of the field of data science produced by the same team from John Hopkins University that produced Coursera’s data science specialization. It is the first course in the “Executive Data Science” specialization  a data science track aimed at non-technical people like business managers. The course defines data science and then discusses different aspects of data science like statistics  machine learning and the structure  output and success metrics for data science projects. Grading is based on a handful of short multiple-choice comprehension quizzes.    A Crash Course in Data Science is good for what it is: a brief overview of a field taught at a high level so that anyone can follow along. The professors have plenty of face time  explain concepts well and the video quality is good. The content quality is a definite step up from the original John Hopkins data science track.    The only real knock against this course is its brevity and the fact that it costs the full $49 to get a verified certificate if you want to complete the specialization. A course that you can complete in an hour or two should not cost the same as a month-long course. Students looking to dig their teeth into something substantial for the first month of the Executive Data Science specialization may be disappointed.    A Crash Course in Data Science is a well-made primer on the data science field  but its brevity may leave paying students wanting.     For freeware students I give this course 4 out of 5 stars: Very Good.,8,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  1 month ago

This is a very introductory course and maybe best suited for high school students. There was a harsh criticism of this course by a college math teacher (http://www.angrymath.com/2012/09/udacity-statistics-101.html) and Dr. Thrun is going to address some of his concerns in the next version (http://blog.udacity.com/2012/09/sebastian-thrun-statistics-101-will-be.html). MOOC is still in its infancy and I think it is a great attitude to welcome criticism and try to improve based on feedback. Anyway  if you are thinking of taking this course  make sure to do so after the major update.,5,Completed,Sai,5 years  2 months ago
Instructor seems very dedicated but the content covered is too basic. It got more and more boring as the quizzes in the course are very repetitive. It asks you same questions again and again with slightly different input and it gets very uninteresting.

I have finished some part (23/34) of the Statistics course in 2014. Thanks to Dr Thrun  I have learned some of basic concepts such as Bayes rule and variance which are used in many of the image processing  machine learning and artificial intelligence courses. Also course introduced me with the basics of Python programming language. But this was the good part. Here comes the sad story:      Ambiguities in the questions  miss-typed sections in the course material is unbearable and unacceptable. Trust me  in the course forums there are many people concerning about the same problems. The most sad thing is: even-tough the course started in 2012  none of the required revisions had been made even in 2 years time.. I have mailed  and reported Udacity about these problems  but nobody responded and no one really cares.. The course was a beta version  and still it is..      In my opinion  Udacity should first fix  and revise the problems in the course material rather than introducing new courses.,4,Dropped,Emrah Erden,3 years  4 months ago

The first 30 % was a bit too basic  but then got really interesting. Even though the topic is about statistics  it has emphasise on probability a lot and the topic explaining about the conditional probability (aka Bayers rule) was the best part.

Sebastian Thrun is an excellent instructor and his well-designed course included fun  diverse  and engaging example problems to apply Python to statistical analysis. Having used statistical analysis for work for the last five years (although not applied with code)  having taken CS101 and Web App. development (both through Udacity)  and coming from an engineering background  I didn't learn new concepts  but it was a good refresher for basics and an excellent way to improve code-writing fluency -- important in the working world where efficiency trumps technology in many situations. I had hoped the course would delve into some more advanced topics in data analysis  but in hindsight it is probably best left quite basic for the greater audience of beginner programmers with little or no background in statistics. The course is definitely worth taking to learn or refresh basics concurrent with applying it effectively in code. At a bare minimum  it will improve the critical thought process for the type of information we are exposed to each day by the spectrum of media. I would also recommend it for professionals not coming from a math background who want to develop practical skills for many types of consulting. IMO most work out there isn't about the ability to apply cutting-edge theory  but instead is about mastering the application of fundamentals and the ability to quickly perform 'back-of-envelope' estimates as 'reality checks'.,8,Completed,Dan,4 years  10 months ago
Course seemed like it was rushed and incomplete (although I know there have been revisions). Material was not university-level. I appreciate the attempt to make it intuitive and not too hard.

Thrun will be updating the class shortly  but I'll still share my experience on the first version. I thought it was a very interesting class  engaging much more than a class at college usually does. His examples are really nice and those are what I remember the most after the fact. At the time  the difficulty felt just right  but now that I've taken a university-level statistics course  I see that this course only really covers about a quarter of what we covered at school.

Wow. I am so impressed by this course. Of the 11 Coursera classes and 1 edX course which I actively participated in so far (most of which were in Machine Learning  Artificial Intelligence  NLP  etc.)  I think this one might be my favorite. Unlike some of the other courses from Stanford or Berkeley which cover similar subjects (and are great as well)  this course takes a much more practical/applied approach and examines the technologies used to actually perform these techniques as well as give a great overview of current methods. Nowhere else would I learn as much about state of the art techniques like HTM. Nowhere else would I get to play around with data on web scale using techniques like Map-Reduce. Nowhere else could I get as complete of a picture of the current methods for having computers simulate intelligence  make deductions  run logic based systems  use collaborative filtering  perform pattern recognition  etc. To get the same value as this course gave  at the least I would have to take courses on Information Retrieval  Natural Language Processing  Machine Learning  Artificial Intelligence and then do the hard work of tying the different subjects together. Obviously I think that this class was amazing. The quizzes were good tests of if you had understood the content of the lectures. The homeworks were a little sporadic and seemed slightly poorly planned but they were challenging and most importantly  they actually taught you something rather than merely testing if you could parrot back what the lectures had just taught you. I had a feeling of accomplishment when I finally got my tf-idf calculation running in map-reduce format or when I implemented a Bayesian-net to play doctor at diagnosing disease.

I started this course with high expectatives from the topics covered. I completed the course with the feeling of having learned something  but not in a pleasant way. Some topics were covered in some detail (term-frequency IR techniques and Map-Reduce algorithms)  while some other were merely scratched  which is ok given the introductory nature of the course. However  although the teachers were probably right in the selection of the topics and the practical approach  they failed in the presentation. Yes  the main drawback of this course is probably the poor quality of the material.,6,Completed,Mario Gómez Martínez,3 years  10 months ago
TL DR: bad structured  not in-deep course  ask you to solve assignments using tools not explained. I studied Artificial Intelligence and have background in ML/DM methods  as well as intermediate programming skills using Python. My general impression is that the contents of this course are not well structured  they don't really connect (even if the instructor insists in so) and all in all it looks like a bunch of slightly related material  poorly covered. The in-lecture questions are not well-crafted  often they just ask you about random stuff you might have learned somewhere else. The students are asked to do homework using tools not explained in the lectures  at all. For example  perform Bayesian Network inference using SQL  when SQL is not explained in the course... And the last assignment is a data-mining task of a huge file  using tools not explained at all (Orange  Octave...?) you just have to learn to use on your own.,4,Completed,dukebody,4 years ago
I took some courses in AI and ML in my undergraduate studies  and was curious about their large scale implementations. This course looked very promising for me. Unfortunately the instructors' English is very poor  the presentation format is very disorganised  and on top of that the questions are intentionally worded to try to sneak one up on you. I did find the programming assignments quite enjoyable to solve  even if the timed format was a little quirky (we had to precompute all the database  and 2 minutes to submit the answer to a query presented to us). At the end of the course the instructor had the audacity to peddle a book he just published on the course subject  which looked badly unethical (as if he explained badly on purpose  causing students to buy the book in hopes to get a better understanding and grade). I seriously considered dropping on multiple occasions  because I have better things to do with my time (and you can learn about map-reduce from Wikipedia)  but I stuck with it(finishing soon). For me it's a good thing though that I took this course out of pure curiosity - I feel sorry for the kids in Indian Institute of Technology Delhi that took it and need to get a good grade.,4,Taking Now,Roma Gluskin,4 years  2 months ago
A very well rounded course covering a wide range of topics. I did not have insight into big data before this course. Now I do have the basic foundation to build on.

I would recommend this course for big data and web intelligence.,10,Completed,Saurav,4 years  1 month ago
The course covers a whole lot of information  so it doesn't go deep into any of them.

"The course covered a lot of relevant material very quickly and not thoroughly. The homework assignments demanded a level of depth of understanding that could only be gained by expending far more than the advertised 2-3hrs/week workload. Being skilled with Python  SQL  Orange  and discrete probability would also help reduce the workload but that was not my case  so I struggled with most of the assignments. Thankfully  student participation in the forums was excellent and we helped each other pull through. Attention to detail in the math slides in the lectures was also lacking - wrong symbols  confusing fonts  poor explanations (""I'll leave it to you to convince yourself this is correct.""). On the plus side  it was very cool to run map-reduce on my laptop  run prediction models on human genome with Orange  etc. The course material is highly relevant for today's computer scientists.",5,Completed,Student,4 years  2 months ago
This course have taken lot of practicality in to account  which is very appreciable. I liked the course content ( very broad in nature rather than depth  which can be explored for further implementations )  which helps you to put together all the pieces of technology. One thing i found missing - reference material / books for the topics discussed could have been provided for better understanding / further depth of knowledge.

The course was useful although some of the areas were treated more theoretically that I would desire as I wanted to learn what existed for solving such problems because I am currently working full time. A version of this course for people who are working would be good. The one main comment was that the guest lectures were not helpful at all as the quality of the audio from students asking questions and spoken English of the guest lecturers was too poor to get anything from the presentation.,7,Completed,Student,4 years  2 months ago
I really found the course well structured.Examples considered gave good insight into the topic. The problems posed in the Homework Assignments challenged me to experiment and learn.

I had to drop this course over half-way into it due to unplanned time constraints. I was definitely interested in the topic and it was my first class from a non-US university or non-elite university so I wondered what that would be like. I think the later (non-elite) was why I too often found myself sharply disagreeing with the professor's views. I've been in business intelligence for well over a decade and in databases for two decades and try to learn from the best. This professor was definitely not in that category. Still  it was a new area for me  so I persevered until my time constraints were too much. I would take it again if it was offered (to complete the material) and I'd try to ignore the wrong things the professor said. For those with far less experience I am afraid you may be taught wrong things  so be skeptical when something doesn't sound right and watch the forums for discussions on those topics.,6,Completed,Jeff Winchell,3 years ago
Good structure  very insightful. Ideally I would have liked more time in fewer areas then the broad depth of this course. Still well worth doing and fun.,9,Completed,colin mcdermott,4 years  4 months ago
"Dr. Shroff ties together a number of fragmented but highly related areas such as search  information theory  machine learning and big data in a single cohesive course. My favorite part of the course is the lectures on ""Load"" which demystify big data with unparalleled depth. The course is  at once  broad and deep. But it is  in my opinion  a graduate level course. Very highly recommended.",10,Completed,Student,4 years  7 months ago
"Pitifully I choose this course as my first Mooc experience.

Very informative about the scientific foundations  techniques & methodologies and application of big data and web intelligence. Definitely to be recommended for people who want to understand the basics of the subject. However  you need some maths and statistics foundation to understand the content. Only drawback is that one of the guest lecturer's accent was very difficult to understand.,8,Completed,Kachun To,4 years  7 months ago
The course covered a very range of topics (Hadoop  Databases  NoSQL  Naive and Bayes rule  Locality Sensitive Hashing  TF-IDF  MapReduce  Graph Database  Classification  Bayesian networks  etc). In my opinion some of them were very well explained and in detail but others not. One of the things I expected was more programing exercises to help understand the concepts. Besides that the homeworks and quizzes were good to put in practice the concepts we have learned. I recommend this course to everyone interested in Web Intelligence and Big Data. IMHO it worth every minute I spent on it.,8,Completed,Daniel Gomes,4 years  8 months ago
Overall he does a good job of giving broad overview of a fairly diverse subject. Others have complained it was too shallow  and perhaps some parts were a bit glossed over  but to cover them all would make it a 50+ week MOOC. I have a good programming and SQL background  but still found the assignments to be difficult  seeing there was no test data or feedback which made it unclear. I would recommend this course if you wanted a good overview or the topics  but the assignments and exams offer no feedback  so if you are aiming for a certificate you would need to be prepared to work at it. PROS \- gives a taste of most of the topics \- speaks slowly in the starting lectures to allow people to get used to his accent (I had no trouble understanding  even on a smartphone) \- they provide the lecture slides in a single ZIP file to download. Very useful  but not as effective as some wiki pages CONS \- no useful wiki page. I take notes but found it difficult to find where the information was for certain things - kept having to go through the videos \- the assignments need rethinking. They are kind of 'simple' once you *finish* them  but it is quite difficult to know if you are on the right track. You only get a couple of shots and entering a value in the answer but have no way of knowing if you are on the right track. A better approach would have been to give some test data which shows what is expected of that. \- I found the exam was difficult seeing it was so hard to find which video the information was buried. I would advise taking notes as you go. \- Just found out the grading will be on a sliding scale. This is a terrible idea  I would rather know how *I* did against the topic instead of being compared to a heap of other people I dont know.,6,Completed,Duncan Murray,4 years  8 months ago
Overall a good high-level overview course with practical skills-based assignments. If I had one criticism  it would be the discussion forum. It became a bit tedious to read through so many benign posts. (Almost a big data problem in itself.) It was probably due to the wide range of student experience. There were too many students complaining about not knowing how to do something. I expected more from students taking a graduate-level course. Overall  I would recommend the course.,8,Completed,Student,4 years  7 months ago
The scope and depth of the class were outstanding and addressed a timely area of interest for IT professionals. Professor Shroff's presentations were well organized  simplified complex material  and interesting to follow. I learned a lot that makes me a better practitioner and improved my understanding of how the world of Amazon  Google  and NSA work. Several suggestions that would have made a good experience awesome: The lectures spent a lot of time using relatively complex mathematics to prove theoretical underpinnings of the techniques covered. I would have gotten much more from the lectures if they provided less formality and more worked examples  showing how to apply the techniques. Potential students should be prepared with strong math  particularly  probability  skills. Each of the homework problems was interesting and well conceived but lacking adequate direction. The discussion board back-filled in many cases but  for example  I didn't benefit from the several hours I spent learning that Mincemeat needs to be patched to deal with UTF-8. A simple note to that effect would not have reduced my learning of map- reduce but would have eliminated substantial frustration. The Distributed File System and NoSQL database sections were of prime interest to me but were given relatively little attention. Expanding coverage of these key technologies and including a homework problem would be be great (assuming that lightweight tools are available). The two guest lectures wasted 20% of the lecture time for me. The topics were obtuse / theoretical  the speakers hard to understand  and their practice of addressing questions from the live audience  which we couldn't hear  was maddening. A process to allow discussion of homework by those that have completed it would be helpful in fully leveraging the learning. I spent substantial time beyond the minimum on the homeworks and would like to have discussed my questions and results. A forum section that could only be entered after completing the homework would address this need.,5,Completed,William Rosenfeld,4 years  8 months ago

I am an IT professional and my desire was to expand my set of skills.

Thank you very much prof. Shroff for putting this together and making it easy to follow for whoever is interested.,9,Completed,Vio Belc,4 years  8 months ago
A good course talking about diverse topics  and that might be a mistake as well. It is a good overview course topic-wise  yet the materials and slides used are not well done and they are ugly and unexplicative.

"This is a great course. I have the following suggestions for your course: 1) Slides have too much text. Please add more graphics  animation  movement etc on the slides. Even if you actually take a pen and write stuff (underlining  drawing rough figures) helps break the monotonicity of the slides. It helps me concentrate and draws my attention to the part of the slide or concept you are talking about. Online courses can be made more ""interactive"" if it isn't just a slide accompanied with a voice. 2) I think the course organization can be changed to better tie up the concepts more tightly. Most of the time I was going through weekly lectures as stand alone units and it was only when attempting the hw questions that I had to think and tie the concepts together. 3) Finally this course needs SQL background. You should add a lecture giving some background about SQL in the first week. 4) Any reason why you used octo.py and mincemeat.py ? There seems to be a mapreduce.py package that is very intuitive and easy to use. Finally please add some more programming assignments that work on real life projects  data analytics  web analytics  big data. The course currently seems too theoretical. Thanks for your hard work. Please take these suggestions as positive feedback. Appreciate you taking time to teach this course.",6,Completed,Nikhil sarpotdar,4 years  8 months ago

"""Data Science for Executives…is perfect for anyone who wants to understand basic concepts in data science without getting into the weeds of programming. Aimed at organization leaders  business managers…”   – Definitely not  this is a course for professionals with according technical and mathematical prerequisites.  I appreciated the dedication with which all teachers held the courses and I am sure they are very smart in their individual subject matter. However  the communication was in no way target group oriented. The target group – as described in the course intro – is not the one who is doing the calculations and programming work. They need to understand the basic ideas  technologies and methods in a mere descriptive way and in order to understand the product professionals in the company.  Business managers themselves think in patterns  pictures and stories against the background of time pressure and this influences how they expect to receive information – hence bring information to the point otherwise they will not lend you their ear.  I started the course for curiosity and for the fun of learning. May aim was to get a receipt of “participation”  I don’t need a “successful pass”. However  now at the end of the course I see that this is not possible. So I cannot even mention this course in my CV. That’s disappointing.  Maybe my comments sound a bit harsh - I don’t want to blame anyone but I really would have liked to benefit from your hard effort in this obviously very interesting matter.",2,Dropped,Birgit,5 days  6 hours ago
"This course was just okay - I would recommend it only as an introduction for absolute ML newbies. It is basically just a survey course that has no programming assignments - the descriptions of ""what you'll learn"" are a bit dishonest in light of this.

I think that the content of this course was superior to that of the other course  Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics. Unfortunately  I had to go over data structures and algorithms - two topics which I'm fairly familiar with  but I guess the overview kept me up to speed in any case. Otherwise  most of this information in this course I found to be brand new. I think that I have a very good conceptual grasp of not only which machine learning methods are out there but how some of them work and what they're good at doing. I think that this was an excellent course for anyone who's interested in machine learning and needs somewhere to start. I don't have any prior experience in machine learning other than some articles on the internet and a high school background in computer science. I found the professors in this course more interesting or funny than the ones in Statistical Thinking  so that was a plus as well  although this could be skewed by the fact that I knew less about the material at hand than I did with Statistical Thinking.,8,Completed,student,1 year  8 months ago

"I am enjoying this course and is giving me a good theoretical background to the signal processing I have been doing lately. Nathan Kutz is a great lecturer and covers the material in an engaging and sometimes humorous manner  illustrating what can be quite a dry subject with interesting real life examples. The associated lecture notes are an excerpt from his book an are well written. Useful practical lessons with MATLAB and a **FREE** MATLAB license for the duration of the course (better support for Octave would have been ideal). However.... It is just a series of videos of his classroom lectures  which are great  but not always suited to watching online. The quizzes are basic and sometimes are just ""do this in MATLAB  did you do it yes/no ?"". There is no forum participation from the lecturer or TAs. And no certificate of completion available if that interests you (doesn't bother me much  I'm doing this out of interest). In summary  interesting course  but could be so much better.",8,Taking Now,Doug Steel,4 years ago
"This course is a gem so I urge everyone interested in these topics to take it.     Before explaining why I will start with a disclaimer.  This course is one of the first in the category ""abandonmoocs"" you have the lectures and the quizzes  but you are completely on your own  the instructor is not present and there are no TAs or any kind of help whatsoever  so in some way this is the same as just a list of videos on youtube.    But the content is terrific and the instructor is a genius!. This course covers very very interesting topics such as PCA  Independent component analysis  image segmentation  signal processing and many other topics and the way the topics are presented is terrific. First you get a great lecture about the theory behind each subject  the instructor takes time to make very difficult concepts simple and he does it without losing depth in the topics. Not only that but he is also fun and presents really nice examples for each topic.    Then you get a ""practice"" lecture where the instructor codes the different algorithms in real time using Matlab  this was awersome as you could just reproduce the code at the same time and understand how things work and what very nice things you can do with the algorithms.    There's nothing remotely similar to this course so I give it six stars even in its current state of abandonment.",10,Completed,Richard Taylor,2 years  7 months ago
Class wasn't bad  it's a tutorial of many different computational methods. Having a lot to cover  it doesn't go deep at all  but at least the teacher identifies some key points (e.g. time vs. frequency in analysis) and illustrated them well. In the end  I don't think this class gave me much for the time I spent (lectures are quite long) as it was too superficial for my interests. The best part was probably showing what matlab functions and toolkits can be used for the various problems  even though only a few commands were used for each domain  it can be a good start for a beginner needing to get oriented.,6,Completed,Dan,4 years ago
The instructor designed course to require Matlab for $99 when Octave is freely available and used by Stanford courses such as Machine Intelligence. Lectures were copied from poor quality videos produced for UW consumption. Downloading of lectures for offline viewing was obstructed and discouraged. For-pay UW course was heavily promoted. For this reason also I think UW does not give certificates to non-paying Coursera students. I have looked at other UW courses on Coursera and all are similar in regards to these factors. There are many similar courses available on Coursera from providers more sincerely committed to the free MOOC education model  I recommend these instead.,2,Dropped,Lars Ericson,4 years  1 month ago

The Data Scientist’s Toolbox is essentially just an overview of the data science specialization track offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera. The track consists of 9 courses that each last about 4 weeks which are released in batches of 3 courses each month. This course introduces the very basics of R and R studio  Git and Github and a few other things that will be used in the data science specialization. It is basically a bunch of introductory and supplementary material that shouldn't be a standalone course. You can complete all the lecture videos in the entire course in about 2 hours. It's almost embarrassing that John Hopkins has a paid verified certificate option for this course  what's worse  it is required to complete their data science specialization track. I suspect this will be a major turnoff for students interested in the track.,3,Completed,Greg Hamel,3 years  10 months ago
Content and instructors are excellent  and I am grateful that this course and the entire JHU data science series is available on Coursera.  However  I am disappointed that I must pay for access to graded content since it is either automated or done by peer review.  The mismatch between what universities have provided and what industry says they need and can't find is apparent here.  Not sure why I or any other citizen should pay for that after investing significantly in college and graduate education.  Perhaps industry and academe should be sharing the cost of correcting this problem?,10,Completed,Student,1 year  5 months ago
This course is skippable if you are familiar with basics of data science and GitHub. Nonetheless  you can complete the entire course in a matter of hours if you are not familiar with it.

The sections about Git and command lines are some of the worst examples. I found much better explanations and how to's on the web.

They would only speak about the other courses offered in this specialization  which is not really fair  I mean  they should provide this information for free  and not inside one specific course.

Not everyone who enrolls in Data Science courses is an experienced data person. Many are trying this for the first time  and quite a few are people who are a little uneasy with English. The git and gitHub applications are command-line oriented  as is R  RStudio is not exactly intuitive either. This course needs to be required for most of the 10 to 20 thousand newbies who enroll for the first time. If you are confident  take the R programming course at the same time.    Learning computer applications and languages is largely a matter of banging one's head until it works. I was a programmer for about 35 years and cried over new software frequently. I started on IBM and Univac mainframes and was there for the great PC revolution  including Linux.    So I am going to do CTA for this course in April.

The benefit of this course to me was forcing me to use these things  which I didn't appreciate until I had tried them. I found this course much more useful in retrospect  now that I have moved on to subsequent Data Science courses where some of these tools make the course much easier to navigate. As for the minimal volume of time  I suppose for an absolute beginner to R it is a baby step toward digging in to the later courses.

As other courses of the same university  it is very well organized and with a high quality of video lectures and a very good instructor. The final project is quite interesting  it allows you to put in practice all of principles and tools learned during the course. I onlymiss more assingments and practical cases... to be a GEOINT analyst more than just once.,8,Completed,Ramiro Aznar,2 years  11 months ago
The course is a mixture of lectures from 10 different instructors of varying quality depending on the lecture/topic. For example  I recommend you skip the big data architecture part of this. Normally I give high provider score for Coursera MOOCs  but this is not like any Coursera MOOC I've ever taken. There are no graded assessments of any kind. This is more like a YouTube channel than a MOOC. There are maybe a dozen to 2 dozen messages on the discussions forums since they were opened a half year ago (i.e. they are dead). I'm just starting this course  so I will update this review as I learn more. However  my gut tells me to wait until they revise this course (supposedly in the Spring) to be more like a normal MOOC.,5,Taking Now,Jeff Winchell,2 years  11 months ago
"This course is quite outdated. I didn't learn much beyond what I already knew before I started. The Spark courses from edX are way better than these. Hopefully ""Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark"" from the ""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"" (also from Coursera) is good (I know their Scala courses  which are taught by Martin Odersky  are quite good).    There are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challenging.    Many of the videos  specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over. They serve more as a review if you know the subject  otherwise I don't think most people will get much from them.    The audio isn't very good for most of the lectures  many having an very annoying chirping sound (from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer... ""teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-teh-teh teh-tehhhhhh...."". Gosh  I haven't heard this sound in maybe over five years...).    The Kaggle competition at the end of the course can be fun if you do the hard work  but you don't need to put much of an effort to pass. I know that the submissions I peer reviewed were quite poor  but the grading criteria that we need to follow as reviewers is quite vague and not very thorough. You also run the risk of getting a lesser grade than you deserve because your reviewer is incompetent  which is a bummer... At the moment the course has very few people taking it (the same people I peer reviewed  also reviewed me  which leads to me to believe that maybe only 3 or 4 people were taking this course during the November 2016 iteration).",2,Completed,Student,1 year  1 month ago
I was originally excited to get a decent  introduction to text retrieval methods in order to apply them in my current career  but this course falls very short of properly educating people on this subject and I would recommend skipping it.      Here is a step-step review of it.    1 - The lectures  The lectures and lecturer are actually decent  they introduce the concepts in a fairly clear way and cover a lot of good ground.  I do not have an issue with the way this is presented in lecture.    2 - The assignments (poor quality)  In this course there are quizzes and programming assignments  and the programming assignments are optional.  This is not good  because programming assignments are how you learn.  The programming assignments that do exist are of very poor quality.      The first assignment is a step by step set of instructions to use a text retrieval toolkit (meta-toolkit.org) to do simple things  it doesn't make you program - only follow directions so there's little critical thinking involved.  Secondly  it uses a very niche C++ NLP tool the instructor's grad student created called MeTA.  It is not widely used and therefore the support & knowledgebase surrounding it is mostly non-existant and nobody representing the course answers the course forum  so if things go wrong  it is hard to find an answer as to why.  Thirdly  currently the assignment files have not been updated in a long time  and they do not work correctly with the current version of MeTA (2.30) and thus you cannot complete the assignment without spending a lot of hours figuring out how to update the data provided YOURSELF to work correctly with the current version of MeTA.  So the course's assignments are hard to complete due to negligence on the instructor's part.    The second assignment is better  but also has recommendations out of date with the current version of MeTA.    Overall I'd say this course suffers from 3 main things that make it not worth taking  - It has you use a tool used by almost nobody created by the instructor's grad student that has zero support instead of better many supported tools out there.  - Instructors & Course Representatives have clearly neglected the content & it doesn't work correctly forcing the student to fix the instructor's errors in the assignment content.  - The programming challenges don't make you think too much  thus not giving you a very good hands on intro to the subject matter.    There are better courses that teach this subject out there  and I'd recommend you skip this one in favor of one that uses better supported tools and better teaches hands on learning.,2,Taking Now,Mike Turner,1 year  3 months ago
I'm encouraging more programming assignments dealing with NLP  and a bit smaller focus on C++ and more R/Py support. It was a fun experience  and I hope that the theoretical approach will slowly turn into a combination of theory and practice.,8,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,2 years  4 months ago
This course has good content but the way the content is presented is just terrible. The instructor doesn't care about making the concepts simple he just mumbles around formulas and papers without examples. As any student and instructor knows complex subjects can be explained if you create simple examples to show how things work in practice this course doesn't care about that.  I also disliked the programming assignment that uses a very strange platform and asks the students to complete very simple tasks without any interesting goal.  I liked the topics a lot and I disliked how they were presented even more.,4,Completed,Richard Taylor,2 years  7 months ago
Text Retrieval and Search Engines is the second course in Coursera's new data mining specialization offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The course covers a variety of topics in text data mining and natural language processing including text retrieval  query ranking and evaluation methods  methods and the basics of recommender systems. Grading is based entirely on 4 weekly quizzes comprised of 10 multiple choice questions. You only get 1 attempt on the quizzes.    The weekly content in Text Retrieval and Search Engines consists of around 10 video lectures that range from 5 to 20 minutes followed by a short 10 question quiz. If that sounds like a lot of lecture per question  it is  and there are no in-lecture quizzes to reinforce concepts as you go along. The lectures themselves are definitely a step up from the first course in the specialization  Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. The professor isn't hard to understand this time around and he explains concepts well enough to grasp them without having to re-watch videos. As with many of Coursera's other 4-week specializations  however  lectures sometimes turn into information dumps where the professor ends up reading off slides. The course does have a C++ programming assignment which was nice to see.    Text Retrieval and Search Engines is a decent course that is worth a look if you are interested in text data mining and search engines. Although the lectures lackluster  they have some good information. If you're planning on getting a verified certificate  it is a good idea to try the practice quizzes before submitting the real one.    I give this course 2.75 out of 5 stars: Fair.,6,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  9 months ago
I expected to learn the concepts and applications of process mining. All of this was delivered.    Like:  \- course material content AND presentation was excellent - the videos were extremely good - one of the best I have seen so far on coursera  \- Tool Support - The tools were easy to install and easy to use - no programming required!  \- Hands-on Exercises were included - so one could actually create models from logs  analyze the models and became familiar with the functionality of 2 Process Mining tools. Focus was on process discovery  performance analysis  conformance checking    What I missed:  \- hands-on excercises for extraction of event-logs (notice: this might be a boring task but is extremely important) - usually the majority of time in data mining projects is spent on getting  understanding  filtering  cleansing data  \- hands-on exercises for more advanced topics (prediction  recommendation) / operative support settings  \- combination of RapidMiner / ProM  While having said what I missed - it is clear that these things could or should be added in another subsequent course.,9,Completed,Student,3 years  1 month ago
Process Mining gave me insights into an area of Data Science  which I think is largely neglected - 'Process Optimization'. In general  there is too much focus on data without an understanding of the underlying process that generates the data. This course provides the foundation to treat 'Process' at the same level of 'Data' when it comes to Data Science. I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures and assignments. Professor was great and inspirational. I felt that on the topic of Process Discovery there was a bit too much theory than necessary. All in all  a great course for a well rounded Data Scientist.,8,Completed,Karthikeyan Sankaran,2 years  1 month ago
I was a bit late with this course  and it seemed boring  but it got my attention when I tried the tool quiz. Then I went over all the lectures again  and tried to see the applications of the theoretical models. There was a lot of Petrie net stuff going on  so if you're looking for practice mostly  this won't be fun. However  I did enjoy real-life examples  but sometimes I was a bit lost in the quizzes with all the complicated networks. Nevertheless  I always recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn about a bit neglected discipline  and I'm strongly recommending it to learn awesome new tools. The instructor was nice  and the TA Joos pretty much single-handedly answered every possible doubt in the forums  and I was hugely impressed by that. The course also features the Process Mining group on LinkedIn  and that's a nice way to stay in touch. All in all  a recommendation  but with a caveat if you're expecting more practice rather than theory.,8,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,2 years  4 months ago
I just finished the last week of this course and I find very difficult to write a review about this course  it has a lot of positive and negative things at the same time. I'll try to sum up the pluses and minuses I found:      Positive things:    \- Extremely well prepared material  lots of examples  clear explanations  top-quality video and audio. Top-notch.  \- Fantastic instructor. Clear  precise and always right  the concepts are delivered in a perfect way.  \- Excellent response time in the forums and support to the students.  \- Very well prepared quizzes with many questions to make you learn the materials and apply the concepts to the questions.      Negative things:  \- The course is too long  too many topics  too many videos  it could have been split in 2  3 or even 4 smaller courses.  \- Peer Assignment: it is too long  the dataset is totally boring and uninteresting and it only counts for the distinction certificate.  \- The tools being used: Prom and Disco. Disco is a commercial tool and Prom has many flaws and bugs.  \- Lectures are too long  too many videos per week and the pace is too slow. (It is ok at 1.5x video speed)      I started this course with a lot of energy and liked its start very much  my interest quickly waned to the point of wanting to drop the course badly. The course fails to deliver a real world case to apply the tools being used for something interesting  something fun  something worth it. The peer assignment was a huge letdown as I was expecting a fun application of the topics learned and instead found a longer tool-quiz where you have to use Disco and Prom to process yet another boring and uninteresting dataset.    My conclusion is that process-mining is a very interesting field where very cool algorithms can be applied but in the end the work is boring and tedious and the tools that we have available today are not fun to use and full of bugs. It's a good course so long and so detailed that you will learn to love or hate the topic unfortunately for me it was the second.        I can give this course 1 star and 5 stars at the same time.

The course was simply a theoretical overwiew of some basic techniques used in data visualization. The only practical experience was given in the two homeworks  which mostly required to rely on previous or self-taught knowledge and experience. Lectures were mostly long and boring dictations of the transparencies  and were of little use for the two practical homeworks. Overall I would say there is very little to learn in the course  and these few things are better learnt elsewhere.,4,Dropped,Dario Bertero,2 years  3 months ago
I thought this class would be boring  but it was a bit of a rest we all needed after the previous programming-buffed courses in the Data Mining specialization. However  I did manage to learn some new stuff and concepts. I would like to recommend to make this class perhaps a bit longer  and to introduce people into d3 coding  since the vast majority of the capstone examples and tasks evolved around creating nice visualizations of the mining tasks.,8,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,2 years  4 months ago
It was an introductory course on data visualization.The professor focused on concepts of visualization rather than using tools. It was generally a nice course  well designed and well structured.

It was dissapointed with this MOOC. In my opinion  it has too much theory. The only two assignments were not very challenging  it wold have been better to use just one dataset for the whole course and maybe one or two tools (such as Tableau). A final project and more quizzes (because there were too many lectures) also were needed. To summarize  the course was OK but it needs improvement.,4,Completed,Ramiro Aznar,2 years  5 months ago
Data Visualization is the fifth and final course in the data mining specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The 4-week course provides a high-level overview of data visualization  covering topics like human visual perception  basic plotting constructs and design principles  visualizing networks and visualizing databases. The course doesn’t have any particular prerequisites  but knowing how to make plots with some software package or programming language will be helpful for the assignments. Grading is based on two quizzes and two peer-graded visualization projects.    The lecture content in Data Visualization is better than the lectures of the previous courses in the data mining specialization. The instructor is easy to understand and there isn’t as much dense technical content to absorb. On the downside  since the course focuses on high-level concepts  you won’t learn how to actually construct your own visualizations. It’s up to you to pick out software and figure out how to make visualizations with it. It would have been preferable for the entire data science specialization to pick a programming language and stick with it throughout to pair concepts with specific implementations and exercises.    Data Visualization is a nice introduction to visualization at a high level  but the lack of low-level technical instruction and exercises limits its practical usefulness  especially for students who don’t already know how to create their own visualizations. The course is relatively smooth end to what is otherwise a rocky specialization  but since the content has no real connection to the other courses in the data mining track  you could take it as a standalone course.    I give Data Visualization 3 out of 5 stars: Fair.,6,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  6 months ago
Social and economic networks is an introductory network theory and analysis course geared toward learners who have are comfortable with basic statistics  probability and linear algebra. You don't need to know anything about social networks ahead of time to take this course  but having basic familiarity with networks will help things go a bit smoother. The course has 7 weeks of lecture content covering network basics  measures of centrality  network formation models and diffusion  learning and games on networks. You'll also be introduced to Gephi  a software tool for network visualization and analysis. The 8th week is reserved for a final exam.      Social and economic networks provides all the raw information you need to get a solid grounding in network theory and analysis  but the presentation style is impersonal so the content is not particularly engaging. The professor is knowledgeable and appears on screen while explaining lecture slides  but he shows little emotion. While the lectures can get a bit intimidating with equation after equation  the homework exercises and final exam are easier than the lectures might suggest. You get 2 attempts on each chapter quiz and 1 attempt on the final  a score of 70%  or more is required for a certificate and 90% or more will earn you a certificate with distinction.        All in all  social and economic networks is worthwhile course if you are interested in social networks and aren't intimidated by a bit of math  but I wouldn't take it for fun. If you want to take a course on the same subject that is less mathy consider Coursera's Networked Life from UPenn.,7,Completed,Greg Hamel,3 years  2 months ago
This is a very nice intermediate/advanced course on Social Networks.  It discusses several topics that are usually not mentioned in other courses and the instructor is one of the most important figures in the area.

"I began my MOOCaholicism with his Game Theory class a year ago. The professor is clearly competent (further proof is found on his impressive curriculum vitae). I am beginning to wish I had not wasted my time in the Social Network Analysis class and just taken this class instead. While the professor's style is modest despite his impressive credentials  this also has the effect that he is not emotional enough  exciting enough to help students who aren't totally into the subject already. Minor item: Some of the explanations"" in the in- video quizzes are not really explanations. They are just regurgitations of the question. When you get something wrong  the professor should know at least some common reasons why you might choose a particular wrong answer and pointing that out and why it is wrong is more educational rather than a simple. ""You are wrong"" type explanation. In many Coursera classes  there is not even a button ""Explanation"" given in the in-video quizzes. It is preferable not to have this button  than to give useless explanations.",8,Completed,Jeff Winchell,3 years ago
The course is an advanced one. You should have quite good training in working with mathematical models  it's virtually a PhD level class - it's very scientific and research oriented.

Cluster Analysis in Data Mining is third course in Coursera's new data mining specialization offered by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The course is a 4-week overview of data clustering: unsupervised learning methods that attempt to group data into clusters of related or similar observations. The course covers two most common clustering methods--K means and hierarchical clustering--as well as more than a dozen other clustering algorithms. Grading is based on 4 weekly quizzes with 3 attempts each.      Cluster Analysis is taught by Professor Jiawei Han who was the instructor for the first course in the data mining specialization: Pattern Discovery in Data Mining. The quality of the slides  instruction and organization of materials in this course is slightly better than the pattern discovery course  but that isn't saying much: it is still below Coursera's usual high standards. The course rushes from one topic to another with instruction that is mediocre at best downright confusing at its worst. That's not to say you can't learn anything from this course  but the instruction is often more of a hindrance than a help. There are occasional in-lecture quizzes  but the graded quizzes largely fail to foster any understanding of the material. An optional programming assignment was added half way through the course  in a course about data mining  programming assignments should be front and center  not added as an afterthought to quell an outcry from students.      Cluster Analysis in Data Mining is another disappointing entry in Coursera's data mining specialization. Although the course covers many different clustering methods  poor instruction makes it hard to gain a good understanding of the material unless you are extremely attentive or watch the videos several times.      I give Cluster Analysis in Data Mining 2 out of 5 stars: Poor.,4,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  7 months ago
I liked the way I was able to learn more about the newest trends in clustering algorithms  but there was too much theory  and too little practice.

This course is my first MOOC in machine learning that goes beyond introductory level and explores clustering algorithms in 4 weeks. This is generally a low-quality course. The syllabus is interesting technically but spiritless due to the lack of context and use cases to give a meaning to algorithms. The lectures are deadly boring. The instructor obviously lacks teaching and communication skills and most of the time he is reading from the slides.   This course helps you to know only the titles of available clustering algorithms . You will not learn any of them. It only warms you up to study the subjects later.  I am taking this course just to get an idea about clustering algorithms and self-study in demand. It is worth spending about two hours a week for watching each week videos and doing the quizzes in one our or so. This is the first run of the course and it has many ways to improve.,6,Completed,Hamideh Iraj,2 years  7 months ago
This is a good course on Clustering algorithms. The instructor covers a lot of topics and provides good examples to understand the most important algorithms.

Sorry that 1 star is as low as it goes.  In reality  I'd give it probably .5 or less.      Overall  the course was a VERY targeted complex statistics class  where the professor would do 1-2 examples during his video lecture  and then nothing else.  NO readings  no practice problems  nothing besides the quiz  which was completely different than the actual examples.  In addition  there was very little Excel.  We received Excel workbooks pre-populated that could help us solve the problems in the quizzes  but the video instruction did not actually show you how to do this...the professor solved all the problems by hand  thus there was little to no knowledge transfer on how to actually use Excel.  Finally  the single TA for the entire class was absent from the discussion board for weeks at a time.  Questions literally aged for 5-10 days before being answered.      Total waste of time and money.  I'm glad this site exists  as Coursera does not have reviews for classes on its site.  Buyer beware!!,2,Completed,Student,2 years  2 months ago

"This class is full of good information and has a lot of potential to be even better. The lecture component in particular is very good. Prof Kutz is excellent at quickly and clearly explaining concepts and tries hard to be entertaining (often successfully!). The major weaknesses of the class are the frequent errata in the programming assignment graders and a complete absence of any staff attention. The assignment errata are particularly frustrating because your program gets three attempts at a pass/fail evaluation based on a single numeric output  accurate to  for example  5 decimal places. If you get a ""fail""  then you have very little information to go on. Is there a subtle error in your program  or was the answer key created using bad rounding  etc.? It is frequently enough the latter to where you are never quite sure where the problem lies. Fortunately  generations of prior students have catalogued most of the errata on the wiki  which is a fantastic help once you discover it. But it's unfortunate that these errors have persisted so long and that the course seems to be running on autopilot  with the staff oblivious to issues that could have been fixed by now. The University of Washington does advertise a paid version of the same class where you have access to course staff  additional materials and some form of certification for completing the course  but given the current state of the free version  I'm skeptical that it would be worth spending the money on. Regardless  I'm grateful that the class exists and think it's worth signing up for if you want to learn the material. Just be prepared for some frustration!",6,Completed,Gregory Bush,4 years  5 months ago
No offense to Prof. Kutz  but the course is terrible. The lectures are long- winded considering how little information he gets out in each lecture. Too many jokes designed to ingratiate himself with the students  and not very many examples. The quizzes and homework problems are inane and do not attempt to convey any insight to the students. That's not to mention that there is missing information or mistakes and unclear language in many of the problems in the first place. I doubt that someone can learn computing from this course. I spent one day doing the first week and I value my days too much to waste another one on the second week.,2,Completed,Philip Schiff,3 years  5 months ago
The lectures were quite good  but overall I found the written materials too sparse. The lecture notes are good  but need to be expanded with more examples. I found the quizzes were too terse - not enough explanation of the question for me. The only assistance is from a forum  but the lack of actual assigned TA's like I've had at paid online classes means that you can't really post/ask detailed questions about quizzes or homework  showing your work  without jeopardizing the post being deleted for academic violation. This is a major drawback to a free class  and one of the reasons I dropped the class. I'd rather pay and get some assistance when I get stuck on a question  so I can move forward. The pre-reqs listed were Linear Algebra  but the course focuses mainly on ODEs and PDEs  - I have much more exposure to the former  which meant I had to review ODE's quickly the first week. The course had problems with many browsers - Google Chrome seemed to be the only choice. I came into the course as a software engineer already with Matlab experience. I believe we all need to get away from the Fortran-ish naming conventions still used in scientific programing - single letters for variables. We should name variables with longer names to help the poor soul who picks up our code a year later and tries to fix it or enhance it. It would be great if teacher's and book writers using matlab would start to move towards more modern styles. I dropped the course as it was taking me more time than I had. I think one needs to have ODE PDE in their back pocket prior to starting this course  and the lack of TAs kept me stuck a few times.,6,Dropped,Rick,5 years ago
"This course goes through the whole basics of scientific computing  starting with ODE  PDE (wave equation  diffusion equation  etc.)  various methods for solving Ax=b  then FFT  Chebychev transform  and finally finite element method. The professor highly recommends getting MATLAB and in the lecture  uses some functions that are not available in Octave. The lecture videos (except for brief opening videos for each week) were from the recordings of his actual course at U of W and about 20-30% are devoted to hands-on demo of MATLAB sessions. (After watching all the lectures  I feel like getting MATLAB is not a bad idea because its IDE is much better than Octave  which essentially has no IDE. It seems Coursera ""students"" are eligible to purchase a student version.) Professor Kutz is a very humorous guy  making funny remarks all the time  and I have never got bored. His approach to scientific computing is not to devise all the tools by yourself but to take advantage of whatever available to you and concentrate on solving problems. He not only covered the basic theories but also gave practical advice in using various tools and methods. Thanks to him  I did not lose sight of the big picture without being buried in formulae and algorithms. Like other U of W courses  this course does not offer certificate. The assignments were in MATLAB (or Octave)  most of which I just skipped.",8,Completed,Sai,5 years  1 month ago
I needed to build my statistics background from scratch. I took this course among several other courses in Statistics and data science. The good things are: \- I like the direct link between the concepts and the applications. Also the concepts aren't advanced  but it truly gave me a very different understanding of statistics in general.

There was one week that I just went straight to the quiz after the lectures without the self-explanation/brain storming of the lecture and I end up almost zeroing the test. Good thing there is a second attempt and I took it slowly. There were exercises before the graded quiz and to be frank the ungraded exercises are harder than the quiz. The quizzes are relatively simple  which is ok because what is important  I guess  is you understand the concept  over sorting the data on paper! (I hate that part too.) Good overall.

"Not a bad course  which gives the basics of Marketing analysis  with all the most important metrics  and also demonstration of some really profound tools. Unfortunately  most of the course material is too simple for a working professional  and the course completely fail to explain  how the most profound companies are really managing analytics of the high level.

I did not like the course for two reasons 1- The introduction of descriptive predictive and prescriptive analytics was mixed with marketing so the amount of time that could be dedicated to marketing was dedicated to introducing analytics.    2- This course was more general knowledge and  E-Commerce rather than marketing. I wanted the course to be more specific: How marketing theories help in building predictive models and What a marketing analyst knows that other data analysts don't know.    If you are an absolute beginner in analytics  give it a try. Otherwise it may be too simple for you.,4,Completed,Hamideh Iraj,1 year  7 months ago

Managing Data Analysis is the third course in “Executive Data Science” specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The one-week course discusses the process of data analysis at a high level from formulating questions to exploratory analysis  inference  modeling and communicating results. Grading is based on several short comprehension quizzes.    The lectures in Managing Data Analysis are of good quality and the instructor is generally easy to understand. The lectures do  however  use some jargon and concepts that aren’t always adequately explained. Unlike the first two courses of the specialization  which are geared toward managers  this course is more geared toward people who are actually going to be conducting data analysis. The concepts in this course are definitely important for data science managers to understand  but non-technical students may find this to be a jarring change of pace. In addition  certain parts may be confusing if you have had no prior exposure to statistics or machine learning other than the first two courses of this specialization.    Managing Data Analysis provides a useful overview of the process of data analysis  but it is taught at a level appropriate for data analysts. “The Data Analysis Process” would be a more appropriate name for this course.     I give Managing Data Analysis 3.5 out of 5 stars: Good.,6,Completed,Greg Hamel,2 years  1 month ago
Human–Computer Interaction is a subject which is by definition practical and whch lends itself well to novel teaching methods. It is our intention that the book and these notes be able to support both traditional lecture-style courses and those based mainly on project work. In either case we strongly recommend that students be given the opportunity to do some practical work  both in experimenting with and evaluating existing available systems and in designing their own interfaces. HCI cannot be taught exclusively through lectures and books and requires some “hands-on” experience. These notes offer examples of the types of project that can be used to provide such experience.,10,Taking Now,Qassem Ali,2 years ago

The best thing about Passion Driven Statistics was the free access to SAS software. The other best thing about this course was Professor Dierker's way of holding our hands as we walked through learning how to use the software to apply what she taught to us about statistics. She gave us access to databases that were the resources we needed to answer questions that we chose with passion. She even got access to databases as a result of special requests from passionate students! I had taken statistics in college  and am familiar with reading professional journals  so this material was familiar to me. However  statistics software and using such databases was brand new to me. Professor Dierker made learning SAS quite easy as she guided us through it  giving us the option of just copying and modifying the code  or really understanding what she was saying about how it worked. We had a great  collaborative community in the few short weeks of the course. We shared links to our tumblr.com blogs where we showed our progress during every week of the course. We used the discussion forums to ask for help by giving our blog links. Speaking of the discussion forums  Professor Dierker was on them daily. She took a sabbatical to teach this course  so she seemed to live in the discussion forums. This added a LOT to the value of the course. I wonder if we depended too heavily on her availability. She was passionately driven toward our success. I wish wish wish I could continue to use SAS. I found some projects that would be great to work on with such software. I found that it costs thousands of dollars per year for a single non-business user! The alternative is a free program called R. I have tried several coursera courses to learn the language  and have not yet found one that works for me.

Same issue that the data specialization started running through in the last two courses (Fast and Crammed delivery) Dr. Leek pace of lecturing is fast and there is a lot of math and unexplained steps. I had to revert back to the web many times and to watch youtube videos to get more grip in some places. The links he provides at the end of each lecture were good and useful. One of the issue that I have missed is a complete approach on how to start your model ending with the best practices for testing and validation. I am planning [as per Dr. Leek hint] to take Dr. Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning by Stanford as I watched couple lectures on YouTube and they are just great and simple.

As was already said on this site  this course is a great follow-up to the Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. The material is more advanced (specifically for me the Restricted Boltzmann Machines were a big surprise  I have never heard this term before) and you need to do a lot of own study to be successful in this course. The quality of the material  both the video and the lecture slides  was quite good. I only wish there were more links to the related research and/or books. Of course  this is one of the courses which might leave you with the idea of how little you know about the subject after all  but this is better than the illusion of full knowledge :) Prerequisites: some programming experience  math on the undergraduate level. Previous exposure to machine learning helps to lower the amount of new information and to focus on the novel ideas.,10,Completed,Anna Nachesa,4 years  8 months ago
This course has great content ( class materials)  although not always up to date.     I have all the respect to Dr.Hinton  however  I found some his explanation were not on the key points.

Absolutely brilliant course. I am in awe of how Mr Hinton managed to wrap up this comprehensive overview of the field. This course requires the student to persevere and think by himself and therefore may not be ideal (or fun-maximizing) for a very first intro to NNs (for this I would advise Andrew Ng's online tutorial on UFLDL website) but has the big merit of extensively and effectively covering most NN techniques  whilst also providing historical insight into how and why these techniques were subsequently invented.

I have the utmost respect for Professor Hinton as a scientist  but I was very disappointed by this class when I took it. It's fairly good on a superficial level (reasonable topic selection + obvious mastery of the subject from the theacher)  but the complete lack of details and insight makes the whole material useless for anyone trying to throughly comprehend / replicate the analysed topics. The classic approach is something along the lines of 'well  I've put 3 layers  the first one with 6 neurons  the second one with 100 and the third one with 8  trained it and obtained this pattern': no information about how those values (number of layers and their size) were picked  nor about how those pattern emerged. The whole class is weirdly unbalanced  with this huge focus on deriving each error function + these out-of-the-blue experimental results. It's like explaining the geometry of the cylinder for about one hour and then briefly mentioning 'oh yeah  we use those as wheels  to make vehicles move'.,2,Completed,Dan,2 years  8 months ago
Wow  one of a few truly great classes I've taken on Coursera. Also the hardest from the math point of view and assignments. The quizzes had some hiccups (e.g. some questions were initially ambiguous  but later corrected) and were hard and required lots of thought  but I really learned a lot from them  especially about how to get the learning formulas for networks with arbitrary sequences of different types of layers. Good treatment of both basic and advanced neural network topics  with great insights about how different areas are related and about practical issues and solutions when working with neural networks (mini-batches  many different methods to avoid overfitting  etc.). The lectures and slides were not perfect as at times they seemed to jump into new topics without much preparation or the jargon changed without explanation from one topic to the next... but they were small issues and overall the lectures were great. Programming assignments were great  although runtime was long (good luck trying to do it starting only a couple of hours before the deadline) and I wish there was deep network practical coverage. It's great to see how much neural network have progressed since I studied the basics at the university long ago. The class gives a quick overview of great application results of the last years for deep networks  and points to some good papers for those interested in learning more details. If this class is offered again (and if you have basic math skills like derivation)  don't miss it!,10,Completed,Trevor,4 years ago

"I love the material! The lectures are good  but this course has some serious problems. There are bugs in the slides and the quizzes  causing formulas to show up as things like ""Undefined control sequence \dfrac"" or "" Misplaced \""  making you guess at the part of the formula that's missing. Despite having a decent background in computational learning theory and a bit of background in ML  I found myself having to crack open a book to be able to do a lot of the quizzes. The material for many questions is only covered tangentially in lecture  if at all. I can only imagine how hard it would be with no background (the course material pointedly did not list ML background as being required). If you go to the coursera forums  you can see multiple highly upvoted threads complaining that the lectures simply don't cover the material needed for the quizzes. The staff have responded by saying they're thankful for the feedback  and will try to make things better next time  here's one exact quote: ""Thanks for the feedback everyone (including everyone who votes for feedback threads). We're working out the right balance as we go  and I think we'll have it down better next time we run the course. I agree that there've been some real problems."" It's great that they're acknowledging the problems and will try to fix them  but that doesn't help anyone currently taking the course. To summarize  the lectures are great  except for some bugs in the slides  and the overall course would be good for someone with a decent ML background. However  it's billed as a course for people that don't have that background  they say they'll try to make it better next time  but this run of the course has some problems.",5,Taking Now,Ben Haley,5 years  2 months ago
I've you've taken Andrew Ng's machine learning course  this provides a great followup. Geoffrey Hinton takes us deep into neural networks  well past the back propagation algorithm that Andrew left off with. The content is more math intensive than ml class and the quizes are more rigorous  but not by too much. Assignments are done in octave (an open source Matlab clone). I've seen some complaints in the forums about questions and assignments being vague and underspecified. I don't feel that way very often  but I do think the learning curve will be steep if you haven't had a decent ml exposure already. The exciting part about this course is the content. Geoffrey is pushing us right to the brink of what's possible in terms of object and speech recognition. The deep neural networks that he is building too are really cutting edge. Over the last 4 years we've seen them make significant advances in many areas of machine learning. Geoffrey is a master of the field which means that he combines technical expertise with a deep knowledge of how these systems work. If you want to contribute to the future of advanced machine learning  this class is a great launching point.,9,Taking Now,Robert Komartin,5 years  2 months ago
I think it's only fair to start by saying this is one of the courses I've not completed. I found the depth of the topics a bit too much for an amateur like me (even after successfully completing Andrew Ng's ML course).

The lectures are great  and the class covers a number of essential concepts in ML in much gory detail. Unfortunately  everything else in this class was rather disappointing. The translation to edX platform was an afterthought  and the homeworks are a mess: there's no opportunity to practice unless you come up with practice problems of your own  problem statements can be a bit on the undecipherable side  and with just one attempt there's no chance to recover from your mistakes. Lack of immediate feedback doesn't help there either. If you want to audit  this will be a great experience. Otherwise  prepare for some pain.,7,Completed,student,3 years  9 months ago
This is really an excellent course. It gives a real understanding of the basic concepts and methods in the world of machine learning. But this understanding is achieving through hard work  challenging tasks are available. And complexity is not an end in itself  tasks are chosen so that the solution leads to an improvement in the conceptual understanding of things. The lion's share of tasks requires setting up a computational experiment  so without good programming skills this course can become an excessive load.

This was the best course I've taken on edX so far. I very much like the fact that this is a full fledged university lecture and not just a summary of one.  I really appreciate the course creators generosity to share their expert knowledge with everybody for free of charge. In my humble opinion it is those people who drive the progress of the human race.  I've done a few courses which including machine learning topics before  but never achieved this level of understanding as in this course. Mostly  they just introduced some ideas of machine learning with practical applications  which was interesting but could not grow in my mind due to the lack of a solid  foundation. A few weeks after the courses ended  the learned things where already gone again.  In this course – if you are willing to invest the time (and you will need to) – you will really dive deep into the fundamental concepts of machine learning and hence truly build step by step a very strong insight in the realms of machine learning and computer science. And since these brilliantly thought Ideas are “as simple as possible  but not simpler” I really believe that they will last and enable us to pursue further knowledge.  The course is not easy. But it is manageable even for non computer scientist  as I am – coming from physics - but a good mathematical understanding is extremely helpful as I can confirm. Besides that  the only thing you need to have in order to profit most from this course  is passion. Everything else is managed really good by the course team. I can only recommend this course to anyone who is willing to learn about learning a machine to learn.  Thank you again!,10,Completed,student,1 year  1 month ago

I have taken this course before it was available on edX via the caltech website but  when I saw that this course is now available here also  I decided to write a brief review anyway because I found it a great experience and hope many others will too.  The lectures for this course were quite challenging but also very entertaining. It is very well structured and the instructor  prof. Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa  illustrates nearly all concepts using simple examples often with some visual aids (graphs  figures  sketches) and speaks slowly and clearly making the content much easier to digest. Having participated in this course I truly believe that more than deserves all the teaching awards he has received over the years. The lectures are rather brief so after watching one for the first time you may think that it could have been more in depth but  I can assure you  the lectures contain everything you need  nothing more and nothing less - this is something you will greatly appreciate when preparing for the final.   If you do not intend to use the book  you will probably end-up re-watching lectures or at least portions of them before and while doing the homework (that is how I did it). I remember the homework being quite difficult and the answers not always very precise (it's machine learning  in some cases results will vary slightly from one attempt to the other). Definitely set aside plenty of time during the weekends  the estimated 10-20h a week is not exaggerated! I would watch the lectures on Saturday mornings and give the homework for that week a shot in the afternoon  on Sunday morning I would wrap up what was not finished and give exercises where I got stuck a fresh look. You may get frustrated at times when you get a wrong answer but I think the lack of 2nd chances makes all the correct answers so much more rewarding. The professor supplies plenty of inspiration and motivation during the lectures to make you want to really understand the material and work on the homework till you get it right!  I would recommend having some prior exposure to programming using Matlab or similar because you will be on your own on that front (as the professor says  the course content is not dumbed down for popular consumption).,10,Completed,Jacek Czaja,1 year  6 months ago

Absolutely a must for anyone thinking of learning Machine Learning. It requires basic calculus and theory of probability knowledge  programming experience (any language  but Matlab or R or Python are better choices)  and a lot of attention and time spent on its materials and homeworks. The book by professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa et al. is very helpful resource (Learning From Data  A Short Course). Expect spending at least 5-7 hours per week or more depending on your background. This is very different from other Machine Learning courses that immediately focus on practical aspects of the subject. Learning From Data starts with founding concepts of Machine Learning as mathematical and statistical problem  and gradually introduces to algorithms without loosing its focus on the principles built. I consider both its approach and materials the most sound introductory course in Machine Learning available.,10,Completed,Massimo Morelli,3 years  3 months ago

Nowadays there is countless of techniques in machine learning you can learn them   but how to apply them for learning  considering data we are given is not an easy thing  also what does it mean to learn  all of this concerns are covered in detail in this course.

This class is HARD. But I like the challenge. Usually  courses from elite universities are watered down when they become a MOOC. Perhaps there is a more lenient grading curve for MOOC participants  but as near as I can tell  this is the same material the CalTech students get. (Reference point: at CalTech  getting 770 out of 800 on the math part of the SAT means 75% of your classmates scored higher than that). I am currently taking the Stanford Machine Learning class (which others have mentioned is watered down from what Stanford students get) and I have taken the Berkely AI class and this CalTech class is definitely harder than those two.,9,Completed,No one of consequence,3 years ago
The lectures did not prepare me for the programming on the first homework assignment. I'd just have to learn how to do it on my own  defeating the purpose of taking the course.

I'm going to hope the Coursera class on Machine Learning does just that.,4,Dropped,Student,4 years  4 months ago

Great and interesting course and very good introduction to performing an LCA. Must-follow for everyone who is interested in sustainability. Practical work is interesting  exercises are easy for people with some mathematical/system analysis skills  but still doable for people who have no experience. Course material points to additional resources for people who want to know more.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  8 months ago
We are in the 4th week now. The course is great so far. The subject itself is interesting and directly applicable and related to a number of career choices. The course materials are dense and well supported with supplement videos  PDF transcripts with additional notes  and links to real reports and studies.   I especially like the fact that homeworks are not hard but they are not ridiculously straightforward either. They are the right amount of challenging. Which is not the case in some other courses on Coursera.  There is also a project starting from week 3 in the form an environmental life cycle assessment study of a bottled soft drink manufacturing which we build by applying the knowledge acquired each week.  The instructor is knowledgeable  methodical  and enthusiastic. The presentation of the video lectures is a bit clinical and could do with a bit more  I don't know  improvisation? even the occasional hesitant umm is absent! ..... maybe this is nitpicking from my side.,10,Taking Now,Student,2 years  9 months ago

Given I am working on Tableau  this is one of the course which helped me to pick up a BI tool very fast. Firstly the product is becoming excellent day by day and is really easy to use.    Recommendation would be provide:    1. more reading and more and more example to try hands on may be on the Desktop version.   2. Create some case and then do the visualization to help bring the creative side of the though process of using the tool.  3. Very importantly cover more topics on data mining using DAX and visualization for exploratory analysis.  4. Integration of statistical analysis would be also helpful.,6,Completed,Dibyendu Sharma Mondal  PRINCE2®,2 years  1 month ago

Course was very good which provided real examples and the labs were overall a good test of what you learn in the course.    Parts of the course are no longer relevant e.g. Content Packs are no longer a Power BI feature as power BI apps has superseded them.    The video format  online tests and labs worked very well and it was easy to drop in and out of the course and complete them when convenient.

I've been impressed by the structure of the course - the video modules are the key  I think. Being short bite-sized pieces of information  self-contained and part of the same lab objective  really confirmed for me that I could complete each video  then lab  plus have the ability to search for and review the content I needed for the knowledge checks. The frequent updates to Power BI result in the course content becoming out-of-date quickly  but the construction of the course is such that a new video could easily be recorded to replace the older material. The certificate option is fantastic  too  as I appreciate opportunities to improve and add marketable skills!,8,Completed,Kate VandeVoorde,4 months  3 weeks ago

I'm a business University student  so indeed  I was a complete beginner in the field of IT and Programming. Personally  it was a big challenge for me to complete this course  and I had to spend many extra hours for understanding and learn these new concepts. However  it was relatively easy to follow these lectures  and Python is perfect for non-programmers. I have learned so much from this course  and it motivates me a lot to complete the whole Micromaster program.  I've checked other similar courses in Edx  because I would like to start a career as a Data Analyst  and I must say that this is course covers the most relevant requirements that companies expects from an employee in this  field. I'm really thankful for this opportunity. It was very difficult for me to pay this course (indeed it was quite expensive)  and making the decision to pay the whole Micromaster  but I see this program as a personal investment. I'm pretty sure that in the next few years  the demand for these experts will increase even more  not only in the US  but worldwide...

This is an extremely helpful course to get into python and the basic libraries in a relatively quick time. Although I am used to coding in different languages  I never had experience with python.

"The intent of the course is good and the approach is good however  the material has a number of error (such as in-correct files or typos in the live code.

PLEASE READ MY COMMENT. Dear Prof. Ilkay Altintas and Prof. Leo Porter  Thank you for this great course. Most students here have the same problems and we ask you to solve it. The first problem  please reduce the gap between courses it makes this program very boring and it makes the students leave this program to another program because students like me planning to get a job or accelerator to master degree and this is a huge period of time. This program needs from 3 to 6 months not more and if you read the previous reviews you will see students have the same problem.  The second problem  the UC SanDiego don't offer credit for this program and this is a really big problem because many students don't plan to travel to Australia to complete studying there and also that unbelievable because this is your program and UC SanDiego should trust in what it's offer at least you should find US university offer credit for this program.

This is not a simple or introductory course. Following MIT 6.00.1x  this course continue to discuss the most commonly used algorithms in programming. Learners should be quite familiar with Python  have some knowledge in NumPy is also better but not necessary  and can fing untaught points from web searching.Professor Guttag explained the algorithms explicitly and orderly  making it easier for me to catch. The video didn't cover all the content in the textbook. If you want to gain the most from this course  you'd better learn the book at the same time. It's an awesome book! The problem sets are the most challenging and exciting part. It's a little tough. I repeated trial and error many times in almost every problem. It's really a fulfillment of writing  debugging and making the program work. Afterall  I keep up and completed the course.

This course receives a rate A++ from me  if such was possible. I passed it but would like to retake it (kind of barely made it)- however I am not sure if time will permit [school  work  family - maybe is better to do the next one of the series instead of retaking this one] - Prof Guttag's way of teaching brings life to the data analysis concepts - formulas almost reads like a story. It is a difficult course but I have enjoyed doing it and  re-watching a few videos. It is a great complement to 6.00.1 (another superb course). Like the others here I am  hopeful for a 6.00.3x  and recommend people to do the series.

I thoroughly enjoyed the course  bought the book and learned a lot. The course is not easy and I think you would struggle if you had no prior programming experience and no prior experience with python. I did not do 6.00.1x first   due to poor timing on my part  but did refer to those lectures. I had started learning python around 3 months prior  and have been programming in other languages for engineering tasks for many years.  There was a high level of interaction in the discussion forums and active support provided. I enjoyed the style that the course was presented in. The modules were coherent and the exercises aligned well with the course material.  The only fault I can make is that some more effort could go into the automated exercise checker as some of the rejections were due to formatting and unrelated to the course intent.  I would very much like to see the same MIT team develop a similar course for machine learning based on the sci kit-learn package  this may require some tutorial in numpy and panda.,10,Completed,Terry Snow,8 months ago
This class and its precursor  6.00.1x were my first tastes of programming and computational thinking  and I hugely enjoyed both of them.

If you're in this course to learn programming  you're in the wrong place. While introducing a few more programming and computer science concepts in the beginning  the course quickly turns into a statistics course  using computation as a simulation tool. While there's nothing wrong with that  those looking to learn more python programming and/or computer science are in for a big disappointment. The instructor's lack of enthusiasm is also a big problem. Prof. Guttag lectures in a very monotonous voice and does not show any excitement in the material. I would not recommend this course.

I thought this was an excellent course and an extremely solid companion course to MITX's 6.00.1X. Even if one is not especially interested in data science  the consolidation of the object-oriented programming methods introduced in 6.00.1X will be valuable to someone learning Python.  Having taken 6.00.1X and 6.00.2X  the only thing I was left wondering about was whether the problem sets could have been approached differently. Typically in this course  problem sets involve a fair bit of helper code and the student has to fill in the gaps to get everything working. An advantage of this is that it gives you practice at dealing with other peoples' code  an occasional disadvantage is that you may end up having to solve a problem their way only.,9,Completed,Ted Danson,1 year  9 months ago

This is one of the best organized MOOCs on the internet.   The staff is actively engaged with the learners and also offer an opportunity to those learners to become a community teaching assistant (I was one).   The quality of the content is excellent. This course hits the sweet spot on the difficulty chart  meaning it's hard enough for you to be challenged but not so hard for you to perform inadequately.   The stuff you learn from this course (and 6.00.1x) can be applied to the real world. For example  I was able to build my own website from scratch (with Google App Engine) using Python. (I learned programming in Python only from 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x)  Also  edX is (in my opinion) the best platform for MOOCs around the internet.

I've got to know lots of interesting stuff - theory and practice  knowledge and tools. The instructor talked clearly and with humor  gave lots of options to watch/read video lectures  gave links to more stuff on the web for those who want and have more time to read. Discussions brought a lot of ideas  considerations  findings - an effect of massiveness. The instructor was involved in the course - participated in forums  wrote announcements. Peer assesment was an interesting exercise.  Before the course  I expected that I'll be forced to go out with my GPS receiver and record stuff in the field - I wasn't  but it was an option. It's OK too  just different from what I thought.  I found discussion assignment themes in forums to be too weekly organized - I'd liked a subforum per theme (if somebody wants to say about multiple themes  he/she may post to main forum for the discussion).  Mapping assignments took a lot of time from me to do. Maybe they could be shorter? It would be good to know required final mapping assignment scope - this one took a lot of time from me too  but I've seen much shorter stories made by peers.  Shortcomings were minor and I'm happy I took this course. I'd like to see more introductory courses  in any area  so well organized. The instructor made great job  the provider was good and was not getting in the way of learning process.  Thank you  guys!,10,Completed,Student,2 years  8 months ago
I liked the lectures and read through the transcripts just to make sure I didn't miss out on anything. Personally I feel the course could have been completed in 2 - 3 weeks if several topics had not been stretched out so much.    Also I thought the mapping assignments were very poorly designed and difficult to do. From an ergonomic and visual POV  they were a pain. I had to keep on flipping between the extremely verbose instructions and the less than appealing GUI of the external map providers (ESRI  ARGCIS  etc). I would have preferred this to have been shown as another video so that I could digest the information in one shot without having to constantly lose focus by shifting from instructions to map and back. Doing problems by oneself is good in Maths but for using a tool  simple spoon-feeding would have been better. To judge if someone really understood how to use those map tools  simple questions could have been included in the weekly quizzes. I feel bad being so negative about this one sore point I have and I would like to thank the course makers for the huge amount of knowledge I gained by going through this course. I completed all quizzes albeit after the hard deadline. Thanks to my OCD I did not skip even those painful mapping assignments :-P !,4,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago

All 5 stars! I like the course. It makes me think in a new way. The teacher and website are helpful to me. Even though I learnt this industry in the university  but after graduating  I seldom work with this knowledge. Learning this course gives me further sight and skills. I have known something new happened during these years. Maybe more reading materials will be better to increase my ability. I'm sure in the future I will take other courses of this field.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
This was my second MOOC on Coursera and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The lectures were relevant and entertaining. The quizzes were well done and followed the lesson content. The final exam required you to draw deep from what you'd learned and the final project was both challenging and rewarding. The peer review is a great tool as well.    Overall  if you are interested in geography  this is a great course.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
"Dr. Robinson really ""makes"" this course content happen. The arrangement & depth of the course content has a nice pace while being moderately challenging. But in his video lectures  Dr. Robinson presents the material for an engaging overview of the lesson  rather than a re-hash of what's to come.",8,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
this is a very interesting introductory course on GIS and mapping. great choice of content  gives you a great overview of the GIS world. the instructor Anthony is just great. He is funny and chill but he really know his stuff!,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
This was my second course in GIS and in short it was amazing experience. Course content  Professor  Delivery mechanism every thing was perfect. I learned a lot in a very short time and was able to even do some practical work which has always been my dream. The education in this domain in my country is very rare and i was lucky to have been part of this MOOC to learn so much which i will use to enhance my professional goals.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
This is a well presented course. The mapping assignments are challenging and take quite a bit of time to work through if you are new to ARCGIS  but overall worth the effort. I loved the mix of videos and lecture notes. They made learning interesting and easy.

Anthony is an awesome instructor (great sense of humor). Coursera is well  it is what it is. The best part of the MOOC is the final project. I liked this course so much that I am taking additional courses from Penn State.,8,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
This course was exciting for me: although I already knew several topics  it was a great pleasure to accept this challenge and use the online version of software - that I know little - made available by ESRI. I had applied last year but I couldn't complete: I was very busy because of work. But I really wanted and I expected this new session to organize myself better and take the necessary time. As for the time  in the first 4 weeks I took just about 6-9 hours a week as expected  but in the fifth week I needed more than 20 hours  some of which spent in unsuccessful searches because a lot of data that would be useful not were available. However  this experience was invaluable. Thanks!,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
I found course topics and materials quite useful. It covers introductory subjects of geography  geographical information systems and remote sensing. I strongly recommend this course if you are a university student or if you interested in these topics.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
Great instructor  lessons are condensed  short but at the same time clear and easy to follow. I guess for professional use more details should be included but for me the material covered was just OK. Interesting and inspiring course. If you liked geography at school  it will leave you with the need of mapping everything you can think of :],8,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
I believe the instructor  pacing and content made this class stellar. The amount of content each week was the just right  and the videos and written materials were for the most part  very clear. The one exception  was the instructions for using ESRI. They were directionally accurate but could have been a bit more precise in describing the step-by-step activity. Dr. Robinson's engaging style  clarity and sense of humor made the class both informative and fun.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago

This was one of the most well designed online courses I have taken.  The range of activities  videos  labs and projects was impressive.  Topic level was advanced beginner  perhaps a little fast for absolute newbies  but quite a bit of review for those of us with a geography background.  Professor is a bit corny but engaging  which makes for a more entertaining MOOC.  Recommended as a moderately intensive introduction to GIS mapping and analysis.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  9 months ago
This was my fourth or fifth Coursera course  but the first in Geography.  I am taking these MOOCs purely for my own personal growth  now that I have a bit more time.   This was by far the most fun  the lecturer is really great  and doesn't take himself or his subject too seriously  and at the same time allowed us to get a glimpse of all of the amazing resources available through the internet in this quickly evolving field.   I especially appreciate having the transcript of the lectures  which for me makes learning much easier.  This took some time each week   especially the Mapping projects  but it was just fascinating!  Thanks you Professor!,10,Completed,Taione Sikivou,2 years  9 months ago
Great course.  Maps have long been an interest/passion of mine  but not an area where I've ever worked professionally.  GIS was something I knew little about.    I thoroughly enjoyed the course.  The material is well balanced and easy to follow  with a nice mix of reading material  videos  and hands-on mapping practice  mostly using the free ArcGIS software.  Dr Robinson is an engaging presenter  with well-paced videos and a nice layer of humour.      Most of the assessment during the course is multiple choice quizzes  which are clear and well-structured.  You do need to do the hands-on mapping labs each week  if you want to score 100% in the quizzes.    There is one piece of assessment which involves a practical mapping assignment.  I was daunted by this initially but it was pleasing to realise by the end of the course that I had learned enough to do it well.    The estimated time commitment of 6-9 hours per week is about right for the first 4 weeks.  In the 5th week  when the mapping assignment was due  I probably spent about 20 hours - though this was partly because I became very enthusiastic about my project  I could certainly have done less if I hadn't had the time available.     I thoroughly recommend the course.  It has definitely whet my appetite for more study in the area.,10,Completed,Ivo Fernandes,2 years  9 months ago

Duke’s Data Analysis and Statistical Inference is an introduction to statistics with an optional computational component using the R programming language. The course runs about 8 weeks and covers a considerable amount of ground in that time. It starts with the basics of data and data collection methods but quickly moves on to cover probability  the normal distribution  the binomial distribution  hypothesis testing  confidence intervals  Z and T statistics  ANOVA and Chi squared tests and linear regression. The course is a bit of a whirlwind tour that packs a lot into each lecture. The PDF slides that go along with the videos are a great resource to review the information dumped in each lecture. Many students complained that the course requires more time than the original estimated amount of around 6-8 hours per week. The course was later updated with an estimate of 8-10 hours per week  which is on the conservative side. If you come in with some prior knowledge of stats and R you can get through in 3-5 hours per week. The professor is engaging and does a good job going through the material while providing adequate face time. The slides are very informative and the video quality is excellent. There are periodic in-lecture quizzes that help test your understanding of the material as you go along. I felt that the frequency of in-lecture quizzes was just about right in this course. Grading is based on performance on weekly quizzes one midterm and one final exam. You need a cumulative grade of 80 percent or more to get a certificate and you only have 1 attempt on the exams  so it is a bit harder to earn a certificate in this course than it is for most MOOCs. If you choose to go the computational route  a portion of your grade is based on 8 programming labs using the R programming language. You can do the labs on your own or use a convenient web-based programming environment provided by the instructor. The labs provide a basic introduction to R and each one explores some of the concepts introduced in the lectures. The labs take about 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on your level of experience with programming and R. In the computational track you’ll also complete a final project involving a statistical analysis of two variables  either from a data set provided by the instructor or a data set you find on your own. The project lets you use the concepts you’ve learned both in class and in lecture on your own. I suspect the project is a bit intimidating to those who are new to R because it involves more computation than the labs and you don’t have the training wheels that the labs provide. The project grade is based on the median score of 3 or more peer assessments. This is a great course for anyone looking to learn statistics that moves fast enough not to bore those who know a bit of statistics coming into the course.,10,Completed,Greg Hamel,3 years  10 months ago

I first learned about this course in Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization courses. Students talked about this course in a very positive manner. I became very curious about this course and I decided to take it.    I am really satisfied with what I have learned and I feel very good about statistics now. It completely removed my bad memories of statistics.    This course was nicely organized with very flexible schedule (no need for late days)  phenomenal use of real world examples and beautiful slides (Sometimes I could not take my eyes off the slides). The exercises were carefully designed and I could learn simply by watching videos and doing exercises. (I did nothing special)    If you are new to statistics  do not lose this course.,10,Completed,Yuliana,2 years  9 months ago
The course is intense and challenging. It provides a great introduction to statistics and R.

This course should be a model for all other MOOCs  and really shows the potential for what MOOCs can offer in terms of (free) online learning. The amount of work that has gone into putting this course together is really quite astounding and shows in just about every aspect of the course.  The lectures are great and the professor is very talented. You cover a huge amount of ground very quickly  and for people new to statistics or who don't have a strong maths background (like me  the last time I studied maths was over 10 years ago!) can struggle a bit in places. However  there is also a very good free-to-download course textbook which helps explain each topic in more detail  so if you're struggling with one of the lectures this is a great reference point. Another excellent aspect of this course is that all of the things you learned are illustrated using real life examples  There are very clear learning objectives established for each module  which helps greatly with revision. The quizzes and particularly the exams are difficult - they really make you think about what you have learned. You can't just look over your notes and pick the right answers - you actually have to apply the knowledge.    The forums are also very helpful for when you're struggling with a particular aspect of the course - even the professor posts there!  The optional R content and the corresponding project are a must - if you don't think you have the time to do this part then I would suggest delay taking this course until you do  as there's only so much of the course you can really apply without the use of statistical software. This part of the course was also very well structured - taking you from a complete beginner in R programming to being able to put together a data analysis project report using only R.  All in all  if you're looking for an introductory statistics course - this is the one to choose!,10,Completed,Guillermo Reales,3 years  3 months ago

Dr. Mine engages you with interesting examples all throughout. You can see for yourself how much effort the team has put into making the course content. I can go on and on about how well paced and relevant the quizzes  labs(via datacamp  another wonderful offering from Duke)  mid-terms  project and the final exam have been. You literally have to sweat it out in order to get past these hurdles. But in the end  you feel it is all worth it. I don't have anything to dislike about the course. Through the discussion forums  I could see students leave with a lump in their throat after the course got over. I think that sums up everything.,10,Completed,Mizar83 .,3 years  8 months ago
Introductory course in Data Analysis  but not an easy  pass for all course. The teacher is VERY good  and her lectures are always interesting  complemented by very good planned slides. She explains the concepts very clear  even if a little fast. The quizzes  midterm and exams are quite difficult  and they are not a simple and easy repeat of the lectures  actual thinking is involved here (luckily!). The labs are easy and fast  and designed so that everyone gets 100% just going through them. The project is a nice idea  even if it suffers from all the drawbacks of peer assessment for a very open-ended assignments. Points detracted for no reason sparked several threads in the forum.,8,Completed,Alex Parij,3 years  9 months ago
Amazing course. Perfect course structure and interesting lectures. The weekly lectures are almost good in length.

This is an excellent course on introductory statistics! Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel presents the subject clearly and provides excellent online learning resources. The format of the labs (datacamp) is extremely helpful for learning R for someone with very little experience in the subject (such as myself).

Great  course. A well balanced mixture of theory  examples  labs and projects to test your skills in the 'real' world. The teacher explains the concepts very clearly. The course layout and order of topics is excellent. The difficulty is does not change overall. The free and open textbook is the best I've come across. It is packed with footnotes to datasets  and has more than enough examples and exercises to get you through the midterm and the exam. The teacher is very active on the forums and even organized a Google hangout session you can join. The focus of this course is definitely not on mathematical proofs  probability theory or working through problems analytically  but geared towards practical approaches using given formula's or R to get results on every day problems. Integrated into the course is the datacamp environment that helps you to learn the software R by playing with data. The nature of these task mirror the theory discussed that week. There are some glitches in this new environment (during the first run of this course)  and the tasks are not really challenging. The quizzes are quite good. Many of the questions test your insight rather than ask you to do tedious algebra. The peer reviewed research projects are time consuming  great fun and an excellent way to get your hands wet with real data  R and doing some real data analysis.

An excellent introduction into essential machine learning techniques. The course is very rich in content  and covers a lot of ground  but doesn't ever devolve into empty hand-waving. The course favours practical approach to machine learning  and will often skip the theory and/or underlying principles (leaving formula derivation as a purely optional exercise for those interested in this aspect of ML). Prof. Ng is obviously enthusiastic about the subject  and the course as a whole feels very polished. On the downside  the programming assignments are not very challenging and do not require any creativity  as they boil down to following very detailed instructions. The assignments remain quite instructive despite that  as there's a lot of support code meant to visualize the results and provide various statistics to help students understand how does everything work. This doesn't seem to be an oversight or anything like that  but rather conscious course design as a 'ML cookbook'. Since going through this class last spring I actually employed a few of the techniques taught in my day-to-day work  and this class was instrumental in sparkling my newfound interest for statistics.

This course is an approachable introduction to machine learning. It gives you tools you can immediately use for practical applications.     You should know basic linear algebra (matrix multiplication  transposes  dot products  etc...) and what derivatives are  and be comfortable with mathematical notation. You won't be required to do something like differentiate a function  and in this sense the course isn't very mathematically rigorous. The assignments are educational but on the easier side - implement the rest of some algorithm  mostly.    Perhaps this is the best route for an introductory level course though  and its a really good (and fun) introduction. I think you'll get the most value from it by applying it to your own projects.    Also  check out Stanford’s official version of the course (CS 229) for a more complete approach.

"Of longstanding renown in the MOOC world  Stanford's machine learning course really is the definitive introduction to this topic.  The course broadly covers all of the major areas of machine learning -- linear and logistic regression  neural networks  support vector machines  clustering  dimensionality reduction and principal component analysis  anomaly detection  and recommender systems.  As with every other Stanford course I've taken  Prof. Ng precedes each segment with a motivating discussion and examples.  Graded portions of the course include a quiz after every topic and a programming assignment  in MATLAB/Octave  after most of them.    The programming assignments are excellent.  Although 95% of the code comes to you pre-written  what you write really goes to the heart of that week's topics.  Given the breadth of the course  these assignments nicely provide depth and meaningful rigor.  The quizzes are very fair and sometimes nicely open your eyes to subtleties of the topic you may not have appreciated.    Machine Learning has migrated along with all Coursera courses to their new platform  which offers the benefit of ""on demand"" scheduling flexibility (you can start whenever you want) but has some unfortunate downsides.  Chief among these is the fact that the quizzes provide no feedback (as they used to) and can be taken as many times as you want.  With enough persistence  anyone can score 100% in the course.  These are minor deficiencies  however  and don't detract from this course's well-deserved reputation.    Those who take and enjoy Machine Learning should consider following it up with The Analytics Edge  an MIT course offered through edX.  The Analytics Edge is more about applying data analytics  including but not limited to machine learning techniques  to a wide variety of real-world problems.  It's a great complement to this course  leading you through the many ways data can be parsed and processed to illuminate  predict and explain.",10,Completed,Matt Herich,1 year  1 month ago
This class is a great introduction for anyone interested in machine learning as it lays out the fundamentals in an easy to understand format. Andrew Ng is the chief scientist at Baidu and is well known in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence so you can rest assured you're learning from the best!,10,Completed,Taras Petrytsyn,1 year  1 month ago
Great course to begin machine learning  using MATLAB archive assignment. Although it does't provide enough theory  it gives an intuition of machine learning. After this course you will be more comfortable to learning some deeper class in this area.,10,Completed,Atheer Al Attar,1 year  1 month ago
This course is very helpful as introduction to Machine Learning. Mr Ng did a great job! The best course on Coursera I took so far. I hope to see another  more deep course related to Machine Learning by Mr Ng.,10,Completed,Student,1 year  1 month ago
Great course  Dr. Andrew takes baby steps approach to advance in the course. What I really like about the course is it's greatly organized and the mentors will have all your questions answered. In addition to that all the previous courses of this course were used as lesson learned  so you will find a long forum of errat  best practice and tutorial that 85% will have your issue solved before you think about using the forums. One thing to the new learners  this course requires a bit of time commitment so keep that in mind. I am planning to continue the learning and I am taking Neural Networks for Machine Learning now from the Univ. of Toronto.,8,Completed,Greg van de Krol,1 year  2 months ago
This is the best online training experienced. The method of Coursera app on online training is amazing. It never felt like remote learning. A complex subjects is made easy by Prof Andrew. Many thanks for this course and all the effort by everyone involved including prof Andrew.     Prof Andrew is the best!,10,Completed,Sakares Saengkaew,1 year  6 months ago
Wonderful introduction to Machine Learning.  Andrew Ng takes you step by step through the processes and even without any prior experience or knowledge of MatLab  within 5 weeks you'll be building neural networks to recognize faces.  Each project is extremely well organized and Andrew is great at explaining complex concepts and gives you great practical advice.  I highly recommend his course.,10,Completed,Student,1 year  9 months ago
Excellent course for people who start in the machine learning field. It covers the necessary basics that you can continue to study by yourself in the future. Prof. Andrew explained the concept and workflow really well. I do highly recommend this course for any new ML starter.,10,Completed,Bernardo Campos,1 year  8 months ago
I have to say that Andrew Ng is one of the best teacher I have ever had. He makes difficult subject very easy to understand. Content wise  I think it is a good introduction to machine learning algorithm.,8,Completed,Gaurav Anand,1 year  10 months ago
I took this course without previous knowledge about Machine Learning. I found it very interesting and motivating. The content is very useful and the progress in the topics is very well given. Along the course some mistakes appear  but they are corrected in the errata webpage.,10,Completed,Karthikeyan Sankaran,2 years ago
This is a very good course for someone who has no prior knowledge in machine learning. The course is really hands on  you will get to internalize the material by doing the weekly assignments. Although the course doesn't require any pre-requisite knowledge but you should have good understanding of matrices in algebra to really understand the proofs.,10,Completed,Simon Collins,2 years  1 month ago
This was my first course in Machine Learning and am really glad to have taken this course to get introduced to ML. The instructor was excellent and inspirational. The best part to me was the intuition behind the algorithms. There was the right balance between mathematics  concepts and practical implementation. The programming exercises were interesting and at the right level of complexity. All in all  a great introductory course to Machine Learning and I will strongly recommend it to all ML / Data Science aspirants.,10,Completed,Gautam Sharma,2 years  1 month ago
what an excellent course.... I'm definitely a lot further ahead in my understanding of machine learning techniques.  Doing the assignments and quizzes also helped a lot,10,Completed,Kristina Šekrst,2 years  2 months ago
"The course is a ""Life - Changer"" ! Andrew Ng is the best professor I have ever had. He is the reason I have decided to pursue my masters in machine learning. He breaks a complex concept down into chunks which are simpler to understand and thereby explaining that concept. I feel like I can apply this knowledge to any domain  be it robotics  finance  biology  etc. Do go for this course  because it'll change your life. It has changed mine.",10,Completed,Kalpesh Patil,2 years  3 months ago
This is the best course on Coursera. I'm happy to see it become a self-paced class for everyone  but I believe that it should run regularly as well  since the course like this deserves to go live. The self-paced look of Coursera courses isn't as good as the live one  and this course focuses on Octave/Matlab programming assignments  which are a better fit to a live course. However  this is just a platform-choice critique  the course itself is simply amazing. However  watch out - it's not a beginner's course. Previous experience in linear algebra is strongly encouraged  and programming experience is required  otherwise you'll get stuck in the beginning. Huge recommendation!,10,Completed,Zbyněk Zajíc,2 years  4 months ago
One of the best ongoing online course on Machine Learning. Covered almost all aspects related to machine learning. I have studied Neural Networks during my masters but this course helped me a lot to understand basic concepts and other Machine Learning techniques.,10,Completed,Student,2 years  4 months ago
Its a good course for someone that never learned Machine Learning (like me :)). The workload is pretty small: about 2-3 Hrs a week (if you complete the course in 11 weeks)  and you get exposed to a lot of ideas and algorithms in the field. I really liked the fact that programming assignments where presenting real problems that seems not trivial at all  in example: character recognition and image compression.  On the downside - the programming assignments requires very little thinking and give only a taste of the topic  and not a practical ability. overall - I enjoyed this course :),8,Completed,NOUGUIER Olivier,2 years  5 months ago
A great course! The lecturer is very thorough  patient and encouraging. The in-video quizzes are challenging and very relevant for knowledge acquisition check  just like the programming assignments.  It would be good if the course was even more encompassing  so it would cover Bayesian learning  decision trees  ensemble models  etc. Otherwise  an excellent choice for anyone into machine learning and data science.,10,Completed,Michael Devereux,2 years  5 months ago
Very intuitive introduction to the basics of Machine Learning. Fully recommended for beginners in this field or for reminders. This was my first course.,8,Completed,Student,2 years  5 months ago
This interactive course is very suitable for total beginner. When I took this course  I didn't have any R background. But along the way  I picked up R skills quickly. After finishing the course  I have basic understanding on R. If you are looking for R course without no R background  this one is the one you should start with. I totally love this course as I can write the program along doing exercises.,10,Completed,kito kid,3 years  9 months ago
